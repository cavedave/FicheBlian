If the reader laughs at the schoolmistress</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the matrons, and is moved by the dream of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">butterfly inside the horse&rsquo;s skull&mdash;then he is assured of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">amusement and emotion to come. He is ready to go on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to Ventry Races, and to make the great journey from</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Dingle east, where O&rsquo;Connor and the girl were so </span><span>unre</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">liable. He is ready, furthermore, to make another jour-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ney: to steal ont on Hallowe&#39;en and catch thrushes above</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">waves of the living and the dead, and see the Land of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Young in the west, and hear the mother-seal saying</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the hunter, &ldquo;If you are in luck you will leave this cove</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in haste, for be it known to you that you will not easily</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kill my young son.&rdquo; All this&mdash;both the gaiety and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">magic&mdash;can be sampled in the opening chapter, and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reader can decide for himself quickly, so that there is no</span></p><p class="c1"><span>need</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to say to him &ldquo;This book is good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But it is worth saying &ldquo;This book is unique,&rdquo; Lest he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">forget what a very odd document he has got hold of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He is about to read an account of neolithic civilization</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the inside. Synge and others have described it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the outside, and very sympathetically, but I know</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of no other instance where it has itself become vocal, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">addressed modernity. Nor is a wiseacre speaking for it;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we are entertained by a lively young man, who likes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dancing and the movies, and was smart at his lessons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he is able to keep our world in its place, and to</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">view it only from his own place, and his spirit never</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">abandons the stronghold to which, in the final chapter,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his feet will return. &ldquo;When I returned home, the lamps</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were being lit in the houses. I went in. My father and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather were sitting on either side of the fire, my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather smoking his old pipe.&rdquo; With these words</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the story closes, and it is as if a shutter descends, behind</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which all three generations disappear, and their Island</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The book is written in Irish, and the original is being</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">published in Dublin. As regards the translators, one of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them is in close and delicate touch with the instincts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of her country-side, the other, a scholar, teaches Greek</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the medium of Irish in the University of Gal-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way. I know the author, too. He is now in the Civic</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guard in Connemara, and though he is pleased that his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">book should be translated, his main care is for the Irish</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">original, because it will be read on the Blasket. They</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will appreciate it there more than we can, for whom the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wit and poetry must be veiled. On the other hand, we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are their superiors in astonishment. They cannot pos-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>sibly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be as much surprised as we are, for here is the egg</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of a sea-bird&mdash;lovely, perfect, and laid this very morning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">E. M. Forster</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">Translators&rsquo; Preface</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Blasket Islands lie off the Kerry Coast, in the ex-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>treme</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;south-west corner of Ireland. The largest of them,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the only one now inhabited, is about five miles long, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the most part less than half a mile broad, rising to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not quite a thousand feet at its highest point&mdash;a treeless</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ridge of bog and mountain pasture descending in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">west to a wind-swept headland of bare rock. The village</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is huddled under the shelter of the hill at the eastern</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">end, nearest the mainland, where there is enough soil</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to yield a scanty crop of potatoes and oats. There is no</span></p><p class="c1"><span>harbour</span><span class="c0">, and the only kind of boat in use is the curragh,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a canoe of wicker framework and canvas covering, light</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">enough for two men to carry on their backs. The distance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the mainland, quay to quay, is three and a half</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">miles&mdash;an easy journey in good weather, but impossible</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in bad. &lsquo;The present population of the Island is about a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hundred and fifty. Before the European War it was two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hundred. The decrease is mainly due to emigration to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">America. It is recorded that the population doubled</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">during the Great Famine (1840-50) when the starving</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and evicted peasantry of the interior flocked to the coasts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in search of food.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other islands, similarly featured but smaller and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even more exposed, lie to the west and north of the main</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">island. The most fertile of them, Inish-vick-ilaun, was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">inhabited till the end of the last century, and one house</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">still stands, being used in the summer for the lobster-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fishing. Inish-na-Br&oacute; is a rugged hog&rsquo;s-back with a re-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">markable headland perforated by the sea, like the arches</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of a Gothic cathedral. Tearacht, the most westerly, is a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pyramid of naked rock, about six hundred feet high, with</span></p><p class="c1"><span>a lighthouse on the seaward side. Inish </span><span>Tuiscirt</span><span class="c0">, to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">north, has the remains of an oratory of Saint Brendan,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the patron saint of the district.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Some of the Islanders own cows and sheep, and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pasture yields delicious mutton. Turf is plentiful at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">western end. The main industry is fishing&mdash;lobster in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">summer and mackerel in the winter&mdash;a dangerous and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">precarious livelihood. The nearest market is the town of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dingle, twelve miles east of Dunquin, the mainland</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">village opposite the Island.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The houses are of the usual west-of-Ireland type&mdash;long,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">low, and narrow. Many of them are dug into the steep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">slope of the hill, for shelter from the wind. They con-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tain a living-room, with a floor of boards or beaten mud,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and an open hearth at the west end. The sleeping-room</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is usually at the east end, but in some houses there is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another small room behind the hearth. There is a loft,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but no upper story, and when an Islander speaks of go-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing up or down in the house, he means that he is going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards or away from the hearth. The roof is of tarred</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">canvas, the same material which is used for covering the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curraghs. There are a number of spinning-wheels on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which the women spin their wool, but the old local dyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are going out of use. There are no shops of any kind. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nearest chapel is at Dunquin, where the men of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Island go to hear Mass every Sunday when the sea is calm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only Irish is spoken and little English is known. Read-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing is a habit only recently acquired and seldom</span></p><p class="c1"><span>practised</span><span class="c0">. The pastimes are singing, dancing, story-telling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and conversation. The literature, which has been pre-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">served entirely by oral tradition, includes ancient legends,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some of them older than Beowulf, poems and songs dat-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>a wealth of folklore, still only partly collected. The </span><span>peo</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ple are fond of poetry and music. The art of impromptu</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verse composition in intricate metrical forms survived</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">within living memory, and in recent years they have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shown considerable skill in making and playing violins.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dances are the hornpipe, jig, four-hand reel, various</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">country figures, and most popular of all, the &ldquo;sets,&rdquo; a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">descendant of the old quadrille.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The language, like the life, is largely medieval&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">vigorous, direct, rich in oaths and asseverations, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">delighting in neat and witty turns of phrase which are</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">largely lost in translation. In these respects it resembles</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the speech of other peasantries, but it also possesses an</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">elegance and grace which is due to its peculiar history;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for, when the clan system on which Irish culture was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">based finally broke down in the seventeenth century, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">poets and scholars were scattered among the common</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">This book is the story of one of the Islanders, written</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by himself for his own pleasure and for the entertain-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ment of his friends, without any thought of a wider</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">public. In the first part of the book he gives an account</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his childhood in the Island; in the second he goes on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to describe how he left his native place and went to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dublin in order to join the Civic Guard, the new Irish</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">police force. It is the first translation into English of a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">genuine account of the life of the Irish peasants written</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by one of themselves, as distinct from what has been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">written about them by the poets and dramatists of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anglo-Irish school.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few words may be added about the translation. &lsquo;The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">English language, as commonly spoken in Ireland, differs</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">considerably from standard English, and these differences</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are mainly due to memories, conscious or unconscious,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Irish speech. The new language has been twisted to</span></p><p class="c1"><span>fit the </span><span>moulds</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of thought and idiom peculiar to the old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hence we have freely used the Irish dialect of English</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as being the nearest to our original, and in this respect</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we are following the example of Synge, who of all writers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in English had the deepest understanding of the Irish-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">speaking peasantry. But rich and highly coloured as this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">English is, its range is less than that of Irish, and since</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">its literature is mainly in prose and entirely modern, it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lacks the stamp of an ancient poetical tradition which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is a marked feature of Irish. The range of vocabulary in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the translation is less than that of the original, and there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is not a word or phrase in the original which is not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">current in ordinary conversation.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With regard to the spelling of proper names, we have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sought rather to facilitate the English reader than to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">consistent. Some Irish names have an English form,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others have not; and we have used one or the other,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>whichever </span><span>seemed the more</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;convenient.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We have omitted some passages of the original.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Moya Llewelyn Davies</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George Thomson</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Note.&mdash;&aacute; is pronounced like aw in shawl, </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&eacute; like ay </span><span>in bay</span><span class="c0">, </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&iacute;</span><span>&nbsp;like</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ee in bee,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&uacute; like oo in cool. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Irish peasant is usually known among his own</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people by his Christian name followed by that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his father or mother, whichever is the more</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">notable character, sometimes by that of his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather (like Tomas Owen Vaun).

So there was no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one to take care of me. I had two brothers and two sisters,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but at that time they had little more sense than myself. So,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as I have said, my father sent me to Dingle to be cared for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by a woman there.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Very great indeed was the control that was over us, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there were many others like me, and as everyone knows,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whenever there is a crowd of young children together they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do be troublesome and very noisy at times. We had a great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dislike for school, but that is not one man&rsquo;s disease in my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">opinion. There was teaching us as school mistress, a woman</span></p><p class="c1"><span>who was as </span><span>grey</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as a badger with two tusks of teeth hang-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing down over her lip, and, if she wasn&rsquo;t cross, it isn&rsquo;t day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yet. She was the devil itself, or so I thought. It was many</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a day I would be in terror when that look she had would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">come over her face, a look that would go through you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember the first day I went to school. Peg de R&eacute;iste</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">brought me, holding my hand, and it was with great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plamais* she coaxed me to go. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to a nice place I will take you today.&rdquo; &ldquo;Are there any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sweets there?&rdquo; &ldquo;&ldquo;There are and plenty and nice books full</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of pictures.&rdquo; She was </span><span>for ever</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;coaxing me that way until</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went in with her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Shyly I sat on the bench </span><span>alongside of Peg</span><span class="c0">. There were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">many, many children there making a power of noise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are the sweets, Peg?&rdquo; said J, and I had hardly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said it when the mistress noticed me and beckoned me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to go up to her. &ldquo;Go up, now,&rdquo; says Peg, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s for giving</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you the sweets.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I had a drowning man&rsquo;s grip of Peg for fear</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of the mistress. &lsquo;&lsquo;</span><span>Leave go of me</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Come up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with me,&rdquo; said I. &lsquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; said she, getting up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and taking me by the hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Shamefaced I stood</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;before the mistress. &ldquo;Who are you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and what is your name?&rdquo; &ldquo;They call me Maurice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Maurice what?&rdquo; </span><span>said she</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sourly. &ldquo;Maurice,&rdquo; said I again,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>my voice </span><span>trembling</span><span>. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; </span><span>said she</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She went to a cupboard and took out a big tin and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">put it down before me. Then I saw a sight which put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gladness into my heart&mdash;sweets in the shape of a man, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pig, a boat, a horse, and many another. I was in many</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">minds, not knowing which I would choose. When I had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">taken my choice she gave me a book and put me sitting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the bench again. &ldquo;Be a good boy, now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">come to school every day.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will.&rdquo; &ldquo;You will surely,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said she, leaving me and going up again to the table. So</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there I sat contentedly looking at the book while I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not forgetting to fill my mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon, hearing a very pleasant sound, I lifted my head,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Soft, coaxing talk.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and what would I see but a bell in the mistress&rsquo;s hand</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and she </span><span>shaking</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it: &ldquo;Playtime,&rdquo; said she (in English).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And so out with us all together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What are we to do now, Peg? Is it home we are </span><span>going</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not at all, but half an hour&rsquo;s ree-raa out here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(But one thing I must say before I go on with my story.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was not a word of Irish in my mouth at that time,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">only English entirely.)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we were out in the field, the boys began kicking</span></p><p class="c1"><span>a football</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and myself tried to be as good as another. But</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">faith, if so, I did not do well for long, for a big, long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gawk of a lad gave a kick to the ball and hit me neatly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the face the way I fell on the flat of my back without a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spark of sight in my eyes or sense in my head. As I fell</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard Peg crying that I was dead, and I remember no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">more till I awoke inside the school to see the boys and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>girls all </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me and the tears falling from Peg.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Good boy!&rdquo; </span><span>said she</span><span class="c0">, &ldquo;sure nothing ails you.

But it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was not long before the sweets and the gentleness began</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to grow cold. So I became disgusted with school&mdash;the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seven tasks of the mountain on me as I thought, when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was carrying my bag of books, and obliged to learn this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and that. Before long it seemed to me there was nobody</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the world had a worse life than myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Near the school was the poorhouse, full of people, each</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with his own affliction. There was one set of them we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were always pursuing&mdash;the blind men. Many a fine eve-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ning we went up to play games on them&mdash;games for our</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">own advantage. They used to be given supplies of sugar</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">done up neatly in bags and we would wait for the chance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to snatch them, which came easy since they were unable</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to see us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But the thief does not always prosper. One evening</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we went up&mdash;five or six of us&mdash;and got a good haul, filling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our pockets, upon which we darted away, thinking to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down in a ditch and swell ourselves out with the sugar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But we had not gone far when we saw the matron coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after us, a strap in her hand, the gate closed behind her,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a poisonous haste on her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, God be with us, boys,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we are done for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now or never, what will we do at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said Mickil Dick, &ldquo;better a good run than a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bad standing.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;But where shall we turn our faces?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the Hill of the Cairn,&rdquo; said Mickil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off we went, one to the east, another to the west, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">matron pursuing us. It is then there was a roaring among</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the boys who had no substance in them, getting it heavy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the strap whenever she got hold of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was lithe of limb myself at that time and I was not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long making the top of the hill. As soon as I was safe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped to look back, and who should I see coming up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hill but Mickil, panting for breath. When I got my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">own breath back again I asked him where were the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others. I got no answer. He sat down on a tuft of grass,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretched himself out his full length, and tightly closed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his eyes. My heart leapt. I jumped towards him. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was not a puff in him. I screamed and caught him by</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the waist, but I couldn&rsquo;t get a stir or a move out of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was too weak. At last I seized him by the two feet and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dragged him after me down the slope of the hill to a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">boghole about five yards below. There I baptized him</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">well but that was all I got for my pains. Ne&rsquo;er a breath</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was coming into him. Then I thought of thrusting his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head into the water, and when I had given him a good</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dipping he began to come round. I pulled him out again,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">white foam on his mouth, and went on beating him till</span></p><p class="c1"><span>he opened</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;his two eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come safe, Mickil,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are in a good place, my boy.&rdquo; But even then for</span></p><p class="c1"><span>half</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;an hour he was as dumb as a baker.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We remained on the top of the hill till darkness came,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for we were afraid to start for home in the daylight in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">case the matron would see us. But what good was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a thrashing waiting for us whenever we would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">go home, because it was the rule of the place to be in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bed by six o&#39;clock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mickil,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is going from bad to worse for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us to stay here. Let us be going.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off we went, slowly and reluctantly, till we strolled</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in through the door. I was seized at once by the hair and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the same. The clothes were stripped off us. Blow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after blow fell till they had us half dead, and then not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a bite nor a sup, but threw us into the bed. There was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no sleep for us that night for the aches and pains dart-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing through us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next morning we set out slow and heavy-hearted for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">school.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wonder what would you say for us to go mitching?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said Mickil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leaned my back against the wall, thinking. While I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was thinking, what did I see up through the passage but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a man and two women looking at me and smiling. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>wondered why they were not looking at </span><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">. They</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came straight towards me, but I was afraid of them and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">began to run. As I ran I could hear one of the women</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">calling me by name. I ran on till I lay down in a hole</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">behind a gate where I found a way of peeping at them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through a chink.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could see Mickil there, and they talking to him, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was not long peeping when I saw them giving him</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an apple and orange. With that I didn&rsquo;t give a second</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glance, but back I ran as hard as I could till I was within</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a yard of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of the women came over to me. &ldquo;Why did you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">run away just now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said I bashfully.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know who I am&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am your aunt,&rdquo; says she, taking me up in her arms</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and kissing me. The other woman did the same. &ldquo;That</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is another aunt, too,&rdquo; said the first woman, &ldquo;and this is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your uncle,&rdquo; says she, pointing to the man who was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing behind us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that the man spoke out in Irish for he had no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knowledge of English, or, if he had, he did not let on.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What sort of talk has that man?&rdquo; said I to the woman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who had me in her arms.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s Irish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s Irish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, wait now,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;till you go home, that is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the time you will have the Irish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is my home?

Then they all kissed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me, gave a farewell and a blessing to the two of us, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My uncle turned back and came up to me. He began</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talking, though neither of us could understand him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he let out a great rush of talk, and another rush</span></p><p class="c1"><span>after it. I looked at </span><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">, Mickil looked at me, we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making great wonder of him. When he was going, he put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his hand in his pocket and gave me half a crown, and a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shilling to Mickil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I never saw a penny as bright as that,&rdquo; said Mickil;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;</span><span>where is</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>yours</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;mine is bigger.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what we had better buy with them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Apples and sweets, and it is the fine life we will have</span></p><p class="c1"><span>with them. But oh, </span><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">, we are forgetting. What about</span></p><p class="c1"><span>school! The devil </span><span>take</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it, let us make haste!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off we ran as hard as we could until we reached the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>school. </span><span>In we</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hurried, panting. We were an hour late.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We thought, my son, we had our feet clear and we were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about to sit down on the bench at our ease when the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>mistress</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;called us. Heavily and unwillingly we went up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and stood before her. She was in a posture, staring at us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from under her brows. At last she spoke. &ldquo;Where were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you? What kept you so late?&rdquo; said she sourly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I looked at </span><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">. His lips were pouting, getting ready</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to cry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Have done with your </span><span>snivelling</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; said she angrily,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;and answer my question.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t in any place,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but when we were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coming to school we met some kinsfolk of mine and they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kept us talking.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a fine excuse you make up! Go out now and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cut a good fat rod and bring it in to me, my good boy,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the way I won&rsquo;t hear any more of your blather.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went out and cut the worst rod I could find and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>brought </span><span>it in to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Stretch out your hand.&rdquo; I did; and I got it hard. &ldquo;Now</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;other hand.&rdquo; I got the same again. Three blows on</span></p><p class="c1"><span>each hand she gave me before she was done, and </span><span>Mickil</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the same. I winked at him not to cry so as to give her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no satisfaction. Then she took us to the far end of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">school. &lsquo;There were two posts there, coming down from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the roof to the floor, on which we were accustomed to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drill. She tied one of us to each post. But, if so, we were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">well content, as no lessons were being put on us and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is what we wanted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were there about half an hour when there was a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knock on the door. The mistress jumped from her chair</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and began walking to and fro without any sense. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were tied too fast for her to release us in a hurry. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>knock</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was made again sharply. She could wait no longer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to open the door. Who was there but the parish priest!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is with us now, my boy,&rdquo; I whispered to Mickil.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will soon see sport.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The priest walked in, a tin of sweets in his hand as</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was the way with him, and he began talking to the </span><span>chil</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>dren</span><span class="c0">. The mistress was as white as death. &ldquo;The devil</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take you,&rdquo; said Mickil, &ldquo;do you see the look on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>mistress?&rdquo; It </span><span>is then</span><span>&nbsp;we </span><span>had the bright</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;smiles.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t long before the priest was asking where were</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and Maurice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Here we are, father,&rdquo; said we with one voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He came over to us </span><span>looking knives</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;Oh, what is the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meaning of this?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Who tied you here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The mistress, father,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will tell you, father. When Mickil and I were com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing to school we met some kinsfolk of mine and they kept</span></p><p class="c1"><span>us talking,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the way we were an hour late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He beckoned to the mistress to come down. &ldquo;What is</span></p><p class="c1"><span>this</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>you are after</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;doing to the poor little children?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, father, I beg your pardon, I was for putting a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">little fear into them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look, father,&rdquo; said I, showing him my hands, which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were blistered with the blows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, my shame,&rdquo; said the priest. Then turning to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mistress: &ldquo;I will make short delay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of putting</span></p><p class="c1"><span>you out</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the school if you go on with this work. Untie</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them at once, and if I find that you set hands on them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again you will have news to tell.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That was the first time I ever saw anger on a priest and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I said to myself that it comes on them as on any other</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man. The end of it was that we had the evening under</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hedge, for we got the rest of the day off.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember another fine day long afterward when I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was on my way to school. There was a bell over the hall</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">door, a bell to let the people know what would be going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on&mdash;Mass, Mary&rsquo;s Crown,* (*rosary) or maybe dinner or supper for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the poor people. It was not to be sounded except when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there was need and there was a chain hanging down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to pull it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It happened that I had not much knowledge of it at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that time, and so I took hold of the chain and began to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">play with it. I gave it a gentle pull which sent music all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over the place. I liked it well, so I gave it another and a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">better pull which sent out the music louder still. I had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">five good pulls at the chain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a minute there wasn&rsquo;t an old person, not a cripple</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nor a sick person, but they were falling over each other&#39;s</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heels to the hall, a crowd from below, another crowd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from above, a man from the east, another from the west.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Young though I was, I realized my mistake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went among them. I could hear the old people dis-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cussing excitedly together. &ldquo;It is no dinner, anyway,&rdquo; one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would say to another. Some of them made for the chapel,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the rest following. I let on nothing. If I were found out,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I to myself, it is likely I would be tied to the post</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By this time the hall was full of chatter, gibberish, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">confusion. Looking back, whom should I see but the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mistress, her brood in her wake, making for the chapel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I let on to be as surprised as anyone. She beckoned me to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her. &ldquo;What is it, Maurice?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know in the world, mistress,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>She went in, </span><span>we behind</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her. We went down on our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knees. The chapel was full from end to end. But there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was no priest coming, and well I knew that no priest</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would come.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while a nun came in and spoke to the congregation. &ldquo;What brought ye here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">set the bell going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that the mistress got up and said it was a strange</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">business for any man to do such a thing, especially to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take old people who could not walk from their corners</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and to put the day astray on herself. When she had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">finished speaking, the nun ordered the people to depart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A cold sweat was coming out on me by this time, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>my </span><span>heart leaping</span><span class="c0">. Whenever anyone looked at me, it</span></p><p class="c1"><span>seemed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me he could tell I was guilty.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end we got the rest of the day off on account</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One winter&rsquo;s night, very wild, with the patter of snow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the window-panes, the wind blowing with a lonely</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whistle among the trees, an ass braying far away with the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coldness of the night, and myself stretched out on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>flat of my back in the fine </span><span>cosy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;bed, I was thinking and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever thinking of the Blasket. When would the day come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I would be a man, free from the control of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">matrons, no school to sicken me and the mistress beating</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me no more? Then the driving snow against the window-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pane would put the Island out of my head, and I would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hear with pity the poor ass braying in the distance. Oh,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>if I were where you are now, my </span><span>assaleen</span><span class="c0">, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, isn&rsquo;t it I would be terrified of the pooka!* </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Hobgoblin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment, I heard a knock at the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s there?&rdquo; said the matron.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Let me in,&rdquo; said a voice plaintively.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as the door was opened a strapping, middle-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">aged woman stumbled into the room, two children at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her feet, all of them in rags, looking as if they had walked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">far, water dripping from them from head to heel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God save all here,&rdquo; said she,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God and Mary save you,&rdquo; said the matron.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;For the love of God, can you find room for us within</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till morning from the cold of the night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will have it and welcome.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three chairs were set for them. I kept watching the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>woman. Tea was made and they sat </span><span>in to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the table. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was not another word out of her, but she kept giving a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side glance at the door like someone who had committed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a great crime.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;They had only taken a couple of bites when there came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another loud knock. The matron ran to the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who&#39;s there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Constabulary,&rdquo; said a voice outside, answering her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at once.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that the poor woman jumped up from the table.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, God save my soul,&rdquo; she cried, &lsquo;they have me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two constables leapt in&mdash;fine men, clean above six</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">feet high and as straight as a candle, a wild look on them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anyone could tell they were in pursuit of the poor</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">woman.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What brought you in here?&rdquo; said one of them to her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">angrily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>She </span><span>made</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;no answer. She was trembling hand and foot.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I charge you with breaking the panes in the chapel</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to make your way in,&rdquo; said he in a loud, rough voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the constables caught her by the hands and led</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">All this time I was watching them and I began think-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing again, as I listened to her going away from the house</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shouting and crying, that it was a queer world&mdash;a full-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grown woman like her to be under control the same as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself. I could still hear an odd cry from her now and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again. As she went farther away, the shouting grew weaker</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till I fell into a heavy slumber.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long I was dreaming that Mickil Dick and I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were walking through a fine green meadow, gathering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">flowers. When we had gathered our fill of them, we sat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down, talking of school and brilla-bralla*! as is the habit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of children.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Childish nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while it seemed that Mickil fell asleep. I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span>looking at him, he </span><span>snoring</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fine and easy. While I sat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thinking what a strange thing was that same sleep, what</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would I see come out of his mouth but a pretty white</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">butterfly. It began to walk down over his body. I stopped</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and reflected that it was a queer thing to come out of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his mouth. Down went the butterfly through the meadow,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I </span><span>after</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it, ever and ever, till it came to an iron gate. It</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">began to climb the bars of the gate, from bar to bar,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>slowly</span><span>&nbsp;and easily, I </span><span>watching</span><span class="c0">. When it came to the top</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the gate, down it went on the other side. I stood watch-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing every turn it was taking. It came down into another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meadow where there was an old skull of a horse which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked as if it had been there for years. In went the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">butterfly through the holes of the eyes, I still watching</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">intently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It must have been five minutes before I saw it coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out again through the mouth of the skull. Back it came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the gate, up each bar and down the other side, just</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as it had done before, then up through the meadow, I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>following it ever and ever till it went back into </span><span>Mickil&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mouth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment he awoke.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span>&nbsp;looking </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know the place?&rdquo; said I, not letting on to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">him yet about the butterfly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Maurice,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;sit down till I tell you the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine dream I am after having.

I didn&rsquo;t know</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where in the world I was. I kept shouting and calling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to you, but that was all the good I got out of it. When I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came to the end of the railway line, I saw a big bright</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house. I went up to it. There was a big round doorway</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with no door in it. I stopped and looked. God save my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul, said I, what place is this? Shall I go inside? Oh, there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is not a lie in what I am saying, Maurice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ibelieve you well,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Go on with your story.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Well, </span><span>in I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;went. But, if so, there was no one alive or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dead to be seen. I was passing from room to room, but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">upon my word, Maurice, my fill of fear was coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was no wonder for you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, faith, I thought I was going astray in the rooms</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and that I would never be able to find the way out. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was groping my way, ever and ever, till at last I reached</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the doorway, and, the devil if I didn&rsquo;t come back again</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over the same railway tracks, and just as I found myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the meadow again, I awoke.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Safe be your storyteller,&rdquo;* said I. &ldquo;It seems,&rdquo; I said,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looking up at the sun, &ldquo;when a man dreams, a white</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">butterfly does be after coming out of his mouth and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking away; and when it comes back again, it is then</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he awakes,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*blessing at the end of a story.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; says Mickil.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I saw it coming out of your own mouth</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when you were asleep, and it walked down through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meadow, up through that gate below, and from there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the old skull of a horse in the field beyond. Out it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came again, up through the same place, and back into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your mouth.

My First Journey Home</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T REMEMBER a day in July, in the year 1911. I wasn&rsquo;t long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in school when a lad came in and spoke to the mistress,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saying I was wanted by someone in the hall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On going out whom did I see but my father, my uncle,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and my two aunts. My aunt ran towards me and without</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saying a word she took me in her arms and kissed me. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span>other</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;aunt did the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Would you like to go home with me today?&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would indeed,&rdquo; said I, my heart snatching at it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What sort of place is it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, a fine nice place.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will we be going now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If we were ready, as soon as we have eaten our dinner,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we will be moving in the name of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will go in now so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and say good-bye to</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mickil</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An egg would not have broken under my feet with the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lightness and gladness in my heart. I stretched out my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hand. &ldquo;Good-bye, Mickil,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am going home</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">today, and I hope I shall see you again in health and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">happiness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The same to you,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">, his tears falling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I turned to speak to the mistress, I noticed that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her two eyes were in lumps. It is not much good to speak</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to yourself, I thought, but I went up and spoke to her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nicely. &ldquo;I am going home today,&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is that you are saying?&rdquo; said she, jumping up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">angrily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am going home today,&rdquo; I repeated softly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who came for you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My father.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He is outside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She said no more but went out, I following her, till we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reached the place where my father was. She gave him a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thousand welcomes and spoke gently at first; but looking</span></p><p class="c1"><span>at her I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;could see that she had no good intentions. It was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not long before she spoke her mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, musha, you ought to know what you are doing,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said she, &lsquo;&lsquo;taking the child home when he is just learning</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his scholarship, and if you left him here he would have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a livelihood for ever.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, my pity for your head,&rdquo; replied my father, &ldquo;I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don&rsquo;t know what livelihood he would get but only to let</span></p><p class="c1"><span>him</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>follow</span><span>&nbsp;his nose in the </span><span>end of all</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, Shaun,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I always thought you had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some sense until today, and you to do such a thing to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">poor boy. In the first place he will lose his English, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so he will be a fool when he grows up a stripling, if he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lives so long. Where will he go, and how will he get work</span></p><p class="c1"><span>without the English</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t it better still for him to have the two languages?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said my father. &ldquo;And another thing, you don&rsquo;t know what</span></p><p class="c1"><span>way</span><span>&nbsp;will Ireland turn out </span><span>yet.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Maybe the foreign tongue</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will go under foot,&rdquo; said he with a laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the way with you is, live horse and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you will get grass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is the thing I was going to say myself referring</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the child, for that will be the way with him.

Come along,&rdquo; said he to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We gave the mistress a farewell and a blessing and de-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">parted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We must go up to the Institution now,&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father, &ldquo;to dress you up, for I have bought you a nice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">suit of clothes.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I heard that I was so delighted it seemed as if</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there was no one in the world but myself, especially as I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had never worn trousers yet. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">change for me in another half-hour! I a grown man,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>leaving behind the distress of the world and the </span><span>oppres</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>sion</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the matrons!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On our way up the sun was shining. It was very hot,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not a cloud in the sky, the birds singing sweetly in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trees. Indeed, little bird, said I in my own mind, there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a time when I thought I could never be so happy and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">contented as you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;you are sorry to leave.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Indeed I am not, but in a hurry to put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the trousers and to see my native village.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A nun was standing before us in the doorway. She gave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father a welcome and questioned him about me kindly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and courteously. When she had left us, I saw a parcel on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the table and I thought at once of the new suit. I kept</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watching until my father opened it. He took out a pair</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of breeches and a jacket, then a shirt, a collar, a cap,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">slippers and a pair of black stockings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;cast </span><span>off from you the</span><span>&nbsp;child&rsquo;s </span><span>clothes</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I was ready, my father looked at me laughing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, you are a grown man, God bless you. Turn round</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till I see the back. They fit you as well as if the tailor had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">made them. Wait till I get you the looking-glass. Look</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at yourself now,&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I saw the form in which I was, all thought of</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mickil </span><span>and of everything</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;else went out of my mind. &ldquo;Oh,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>dad</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am a great sport for fineness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Out we went and down the road again, and before long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I struck up a whistling tune, every step as long as my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father&rsquo;s the way people would know I was a man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a little while we met my two aunts. They tore me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">asunder with kisses, for women are the very devil for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plamas, so that I did not like to meet them at all. Why</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wouldn&rsquo;t they take it fine and soft like a man? Not at all,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they must be fawning on you every time they come across</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When my aunts were satisfied, each of them put a half</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crown in my pocket, with a good deal more I had got</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from others, and now I had my two hands down in my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pockets, making music out of the coins with my fingers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a custom in the district, when a boy was wearing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his first suit, for him to go from house to house through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the village, and it is he would be puffed up with pride</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coming home in the evening with all the money he was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after getting during the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were soon in the town, the three in front of me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I behind, looking at myself and taking a good, long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stride to give myself the look of a man. We went into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shop of Martin Kane in the big street.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God bless your lives,&rdquo; said Martin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Long may you live,&rdquo; said my aunt.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who is the lad along with your&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a son of mine,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I would never have known him.

I sat listening to them shyly, like a dog listening to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">music, but I could not make any sense out of it, I slipped</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">across to my aunt and gave her a nudge in the back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What sort of talk is that going on between my father</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the other man?&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s Irish, ast&oacute;r*,&rdquo; said she, putting her arms round</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me and kissing me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">* My treasure.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I would rather the frost than that to be done to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I got myself free of her I slunk away to the door,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where I watched the people passing up and down, think-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing still of the silly ways of women that you can&rsquo;t speak</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to them without their leaping at you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father, uncle, and Martin were now pretty merry</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the drink. &ldquo;Wait here till I get a car,&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be long,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In half an hour he came back with it. We were ready</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">waiting, and I longing for the road in order to see the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">country, for I had no knowledge of it, and so my father</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was giving me the name of every place. Before long I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see the sea, ever and ever, till we came to Slea Head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now, Maurice, see your native place!&rdquo; said my father,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretching out his hand north-west to a small island which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had been torn out from the mainland. I could not speak:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a lump came in my throat when I saw the Island.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;But how can the horse get in there?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at last.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We will go in with a curragh*,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*canoe of wicker covered with canvas and tarred.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What sort of a thing is a curragh?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped questioning, and went on thinking and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looking out. I saw little white houses huddled together in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the middle of the Island, a great wild hill straight to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">west with no more houses to be seen, only a tower on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">peak of the hill and the hillside white with sheep. I did</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not like the look of it. I think, said I to myself, it is not a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">good place. While those thoughts were passing through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my mind, the car stopped, the people got out, and my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>father</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lifted me down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where are we going now?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a week-day, and, as soon as we reached the top</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the cliff, the King of the Island came up with his post-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bag on his back. He spoke to my father, but not a word</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could I understand. There were many others round the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>place and they all </span><span>with</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their own talk. I don&rsquo;t know in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the world, said I in my own mind, will the day ever come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I will be able to understand them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King turned to me. &lsquo;&lsquo;Musha, how are you?&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he, stretching out his hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at him&mdash;a fine, courteous, mannerly, well-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>favoured</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;(in English).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;I think you have no understand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing of the Irish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;I have not,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But he himself had the two languages, fluent and vig-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>orous</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;How does it please you to be going into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Island?&rdquo; he asked me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;It does not look too nice alto-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>gether</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word, Shaun,&rdquo; said the King, turning to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father, &ldquo;it is time for us to be starting in.&rdquo; And he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">began to move down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was watching the white crests on the sea below. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span>good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gale of wind was blowing from the south-west. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moved down through a great cliff, a rough, narrow little</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">path before us. When I came in sight of the quay, what</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did I sce but twenty black beetles twice as big as a cowl</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, dad,&rdquo; said I, &lsquo;&lsquo;are those beetles dangerous?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The King gave a big, hearty laugh which took an echo</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out of the cliff, for he was a fine strong man with a voice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">without any hoarseness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, my boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;&lsquo;it is no bad guess you made,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and you are not the first that gave them that name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we got down to the quay, I looked up at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">height of the cliff above me, yellow vetchling growing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here and there, a terrible noise from the waves breaking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">below. I saw a big black bird up in the middle of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cliff where it had made its nest. Oh Lord, said I to myself,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how do you keep your senses up there at all!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I turned my eyes towards the slip and what did</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I see but one of the big black beetles walking out towards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me. My heart leapt. I caught hold of my aunt&rsquo;s shawl,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crying, &ldquo;Oh, the beetle!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that is a curragh they are</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">carrying down on their backs.&rdquo; And she snatched another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kiss from me. I thought of telling her that it was a nasty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">habit of women, but I held my tongue.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The curragh was now afloat, like a cork on the water,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as light as an egg-shell. In went my uncle, and the way</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he set her rocking I thought every moment she would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">overturn. In went the King, and, faith, I was sure she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would go down with the weight that was in the man. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the last to be put in. The King was seated at his ease</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the thwart, his pipe lit. My aunts were in the stern,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lat their feet sitting on a tin of sweets.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;let us move her out in the name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon the curragh was mounting the waves, then down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again on the other side, sending bright jets of foam into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the air every time she struck the water. I liked it well</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">until we were in Mid-Bay. Then I began to feel my guts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going in and out of each other, and as the curragh rose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and fell I became seven times worse. I cried out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t fear, but something is coming over me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which isn&rsquo;t right.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lift up your head, my boy,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and take</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a whiff of the wind.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did so, but it was no help. Before long a streak of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pain ran across my chest. I wanted to throw up. I tried,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but I could not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Heave it up,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;and nothing more will</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ail you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seven attempts I made, but with no success.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Put your hand back in your throat,&rdquo; said my father,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;as far back as it will go, and then you will have it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did as he said, but I did not like it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it the way I am worst when I put my hand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back in my mouth?&rdquo; :</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind that, but leave it well back until the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">burden comes up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tried again and again. Every time I pushed my hand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back the desire to retch would run through my body. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kept my hand back patiently, ever and ever, till at last</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt my belly beating against the small of my back. Then</span></p><p class="c1"><span>up came the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>burden and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I threw it out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My uncle was on the thwart in the bows rowing hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at me and gave out a great rush of talk. But,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">alas, I no more knew what he was saying than the oar</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in his hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were only a quarter of a mile from land now, with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a fine view of the Island before us. The wind had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dropped. There was not a breath in the sky, a dead calm</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the sea, a wisp of smoke rising up straight from every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chimney on the Island; the sun as yellow as gold shining</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over the Pass of the Hillslope from the west; a curragh</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards us from the north, and another from the south;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an echo in the coves from the barking of the dogs, and,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when that ceased, the corncrake crying &ldquo;Droach, droach,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">droach!&rdquo; The beauty of the place filled my heart with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">delight. Soon I saw people running down by every path</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;two, three, four! At last it was beyond me to count</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them. They were coming like ants, some of them running,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others walking slowly, till they were all together in a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crowd above the quay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went in through a narrow creek no wider than the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curragh. My eyes opened wide as I looked at the pool</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">within. Not an inch of the slip but was covered with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">children and grown men. You would think it was greed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was on them to tear the curragh asunder, and they chat-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>tering</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span>clamouring</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like a flock of geese a dog would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">send scattering.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The curragh stretched up alongside the slip. I got out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The crowd closed round, all but the children who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gathered round myself, every one of them staring at me,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some with a finger in their mouths, others coming up be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>hind</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me. A shamefaced feeling came over me with the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>way</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;they were peering at me. When I looked at them they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would smile and hide their faces one behind another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be off!&rdquo; said the King to the children who were in his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way. They scattered in fear. And now the men had the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curragh on their backs and were putting her on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stays. I was standing on the top of the slip, a little afraid,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for before me was a stout little lad as plump as a young</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pig. He kept staring at me out of his big blue eyes, his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nose dripping, his finger in his mouth and he chewing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it. He looked at my head and then at my feet. Then he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moved round to examine me behind. I could feel his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">warm breath on the back of my neck. I put my hand in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my pocket and gave him some sweets so that he would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take his close face away from me, upon which he ran off</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the others. But when they saw the sweets they all came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">round again pressing in upon me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment down the path came an old man. He</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked at me smiling. Coming up he embraced and kissed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me and began to talk to me in fine English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, isn&rsquo;t it a strange thing that you would not know</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your own grandfather?&rdquo; said he with a laugh. &ldquo;Come up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with me now,&rdquo; said he, taking me by the hand. But, oh</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lord, it was a good half-hour before we reached the house</span></p><p class="c1"><span>on account of all the old women who came out to </span><span>wel</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>come me</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;The devil take you,&rdquo; said an old man who was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing near, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t choke the child!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The house put great wonder on me. I had never seen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the like of it before. It was small and narrow, with a felt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roof, the walls outside bright with lime, a fine glowing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fire sending warmth into every corner, and four s&uacute;g&aacute;n*</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chairs around the hearth. I sat down on one of them. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span>dog</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was lying in the cinders. When I patted him with my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hand he leapt up with a growl, drew his tail between his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">legs, and slunk away into the corner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had two sisters and two brothers in the house, so I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did not feel lonesome. When everything was ready we</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Rope made of hay used for seating chairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>sat </span><span>in to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the table. And a fine, wholesome table it was for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">good, broken potatoes and two big plates of yellow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bream&mdash;the custom of the Island at the fall of night.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father and my grandfather and my two sisters were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talking in Irish, but I could not understand them. Now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then they would look at me and smile. After a while</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">two boys came in, then three girls, and so on until the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>house</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was full.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When supper was over my sister swept the floor and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shook sand over it. I was sitting on the chair, watching all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that was going on. In another little while the lamp was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lit. I could see the dry sand sparkling on the floor in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lamplight. Then a sound behind me made me turn</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">round, It seemed to be within the hearth. I turned to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;making music in the hearth?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Did you </span><span>never</span><span>&nbsp;hear that? It </span><span>is a cricket</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile a young man had come in with a melodium</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">under his arm and now he struck up a tune, Two boys</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and two girls came out on the floor, and it would raise</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the dead from the grave to watch them dancing the four-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">handed reel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at the clock. To my surprise it was midnight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had not felt the time passing. Musha, said I to myself,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if I were in Dingle now, it is long since I would have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">been in bed with Mickil beside me, and great talk we</span></p><p class="c1"><span>would have </span><span>had</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;together!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The dance was getting wilder and wilder. A soft drop</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of sweat</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was coming out on the boys. When it was over</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they sat down and all clapped hands.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Why are they doing that?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to my grandfather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They are urging Eileen to sing,&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment she began. It was delightful to listen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to her in the stillness of the night, everyone silent, with</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their chins on their hands, not a word out of them save</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now and then, at the end of the verse, when my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father would cry, &ldquo;My love for ever,&rsquo; Eileen,&rsquo; and that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the first bit of Irish I picked up that night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the song was finished everyone clapped again</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and the </span><span>clamour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;spread through the house, a couple here</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a couple there whispering together, all of them full of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bright laughter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while, my father whispered in my ear, &ldquo;Ask</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your grandfather to sing. He has a fine voice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Won&#39;t you give us a song yourself now, grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father?&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will not refuse you,&rdquo; said he, smiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leaning his cheek on his hand, he struck up &ldquo;&Eacute;amonn</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">M&aacute;g&aacute;ine,&rdquo; and there is no doubt but he was a fine singer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in those days. Listening to him as he came to the end of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">each verse, I would feel a shiver of delight in my blood,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and it is no wonder, with the sweetness of the song and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the tremor of his voice. Every word came out clearly. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did not understand the meaning of the words, but the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">other part of the song was plain to me&mdash;the voice, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tremor, and the sweetness. &lsquo;There was not a sound from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anyone, only the cricket, which had not ceased its own</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">music in the hearth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he came to the end: &ldquo;My love for ever!&rdquo; I cried</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">aloud in Irish. Everyone laughed and clapped their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hands.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was now very late. The people began to scatter home-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ward to the white gable.? Soon we were all asleep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1A blessing signifying praise.</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">2 That is, to bed.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">III. The Island</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wou tp you like to go up to the hill with me?&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather, putting the straddle on the ass to bring</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home a load of turf.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fine, calm, sunny day. My father had gone at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sparrow&rsquo;s chirp lobster-fishing to Inish-vick-ilaun in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the west and was not to return till Saturday.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went up the road, my grandfather with a stick in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one hand, the other holding his pipe in his mouth for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lack of teeth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we reached the top of the road we had a fine view</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">between us and the horizon to the south&mdash;the Great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Skellig and Skellig Michael clearly to be seen, Iveragh</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretched out in the sunshine to the south-east, not a puff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of air nor a cloud in the sky, herring-gulls in hundreds</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around the trawlers which were fishing out in the bay,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">larks warbling sweetly over the heather, young lambs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dancing and playing tricks on one another like school</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">children who would be let out in the middle of the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked on until we reached Hill Head. &ldquo;Look</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where your father is lobster-fishing,&rdquo; said my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father, pointing west towards the Inish. &ldquo;Oh, it is grand</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to be up </span><span>in that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Island on such a day as this. Do you see</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the house?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I stopped and looked. &ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look carefully at the middle of the Island and you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will see the sun sparkling on something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh! Is that it? I dare say you were often there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My sorrow, I spent a great part of my life going out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to it, and it is little the shoe or stocking was worn in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">those days, not even a drop of tea to be had, nor any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What </span><span>used</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>you to have</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indian meal, oatmeal, potatoes, and fine fish from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea; and they left their mark on the people. Little sick-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ness or infection came to them. Arra, man, it is the way</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with them now that they have shoes on them as soon as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they can crawl, not to mention all the clothes they wear,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and for all that they are weak, and will be. Would you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believe that it is many a day I left the house at sunrise,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>myself and Stephen </span><span>O&rsquo;Donlevy</span><span class="c0">, Pad Mor, and Shaun</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O&#39;Carna, for we were the crew of the one boat, dear God</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bless their souls, they are all on the way of truth now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As he spoke, the tears fell from the old man and he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stopped for a while as if to put from him the catch at his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, drawing a long sigh, &ldquo;would you be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>lieve</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it, we would have nothing on leaving the house but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">five or six cold potatoes and we would not come home</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">until the blackness and blindness of the night? Where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is the man who would stand such hardship now? Upon</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my word he does not exist.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I doubt he does not.

Do</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you see that tower above? At first it was to be built on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">summit of the Cr&oacute; to the west and the road was to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">made up to it. But when they got as far as this they were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">overcome with laziness, so the head man said it was too</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">costly to make the road all the way to the Cr&oacute; and they</span></p><p class="c1"><span>went no </span><span>farther</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with the road but built the tower up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there instead.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t remember it being made?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Scarcely. But my father, God have mercy on his soul</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and the souls of the </span><span>dead, was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;working on it. His wages</span></p><p class="c1"><span>were only </span><span>fivepence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha,&rdquo; said I with a laugh, &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t it very small</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pay?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word, Maurice, it wasn&rsquo;t too bad for that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time. There was no flour to be bought, no tea or sugar.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had our own food and our own clothes&mdash;the gather-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing of the strand, the hunt of the hill, the fish of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea and the wool of the sheep. The devil a bit was there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to buy, Maurice, save tobacco, and you could get a</span></p><p class="c1"><span>bandle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of that for threepence. So where was the spend-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were silent then for a while until we reached Gusty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gap, with a view now of the north coast of the Island,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where the waves were thundering in from the ocean and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">breaking against the rugged, upstanding cliffs, sending</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">jets of foam as far as you could see into the sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t it a wild place, daddo*?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">*Name for grandfather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is indeed. Do you see that rock below? It is called</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the L&eacute;char Rock, and I will tell you how it got the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">name.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sat down on a tuft of grass, took off his hat and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>passed his hand back over his </span><span>grey</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hair. &ldquo;I was only four</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">years old, but I remember well the day when a sailing-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ship called the Lochar struck that rock below, Five sailors</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came safe out of her. They swam ashore and climbed up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the cliff and not much of the morning was spent when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they walked down into the village, not a stitch of clothes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on them but the same as when they were born. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wonder of the world was on the people of the village as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to where they had come from, and they could not under-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stand their speech. My father brought two of them to our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house, Pad Mor took in another two, and it was Tomas</span></p><p class="c1"><span>O&rsquo;Carna, I think, </span><span>who took</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>in the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fifth man. It was, in-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">deed; I remember now. My father asked them where they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were from and what was their cargo. One of them had a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">few words of English and he gave my father to under-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stand that it was wheat they had on board. The place</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they had left was Halifax and they had spent three</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">months on the sea, tossed east and west until the gale</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">threw them in on that rock below. Soon afterwards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">storm broke up the ship and the coves and strands were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">filled with wheat. We lived the lives of gentlemen while</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it lasted. My father had so much gathered in that we had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">enough for a whole long year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, now, that is a wonderful story,&rdquo; said L</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather got up and we walked on towards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Doon to the </span><span>turfstack</span><span class="c0">. I didn&rsquo;t notice the time passing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">until we had both panniers full and were on our way</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back across the hillside. My grandfather was teaching me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trish all the way home, and I was well pleased with all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the knowledge I was getting from him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had a brother and sister, Michael and Eileen, going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to school at that time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What about coming to school with us?&rdquo; said Eileen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.

The master had not come</span></p><p class="c1"><span>yet so we sat down </span><span>on the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ditch. A crowd of boys were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kicking a stocking football. I had never seen the like of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it before&mdash;the heel of a stocking full of crushed straw and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the mouth sewn up. There was a head of sweat on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">players, and no wonder; the top of the village against the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bottom of the village and the bottom always winning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were giving each other a terrible pounding, with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bruises and cut shins in plenty, sparks flying from nailed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">boots and everyone panting and groaning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The master is coming,&rdquo; said Eileen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked up and saw him walking down through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glen&mdash;a short, stout man with a big belly out before him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He opened the door, rang the bell, and we went in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not long before he noticed me. &ldquo;What is your</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">name?&rdquo; I told him. &lsquo;Where were you till now?&rdquo; &ldquo;In</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dingle.&rdquo; &ldquo;Were you going to school?&rdquo; &ldquo;I was, master.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What class were you in?&rdquo; &ldquo;The fifth class.&rdquo; &ldquo;Good boy,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he, opening the roll-book and writing down my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">name,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isat down on a bench beside a fine gentle lad, a sturdy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">little lump of a fellow. An arithmetic lesson was going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on. I soon had my sums done and put down my pen and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked around. All had their heads bent except two, who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were already finished like myself. The stout little fellow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nudged me. &ldquo;I see you are very quick at your tables.

I was picking up Ivish rapidly,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">getting to know the boys and girls and becoming a fine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talker dependent on no one but as good as another at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the language.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day I was at school, Tomas on one side of me and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Michael Peg Mor*? on the </span><span>other</span><span class="c0">. The master walked out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the yard. We began playing tricks on each other. But</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he had only gone down behind the school and he put in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his head through the bottom of the window where we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could not see him. We were having a great ree-raa when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>everyone</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;began to laugh and look at us. We wondered,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">guessing something must be wrong. Looking round, we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">began to tremble hand and foot when we saw the master.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9 c11">*Thomas (grandson of) fair-haired Owen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c9">(Michael (son of) </span><span class="c9">big</span><span class="c11 c9">&nbsp;Peg.)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hal hal when the cat&rsquo;s away the mice will play.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That is the only time they have for it, said I in my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">own mind. &ldquo;Your soul to the devil, Michael, we are done</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The master came in as white as the wall, his two nostrils</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wide open.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A blow across the legs, another across the back and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then across the legs again. But though the pain was going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to our hearts we let on there was nothing in the world we</span></p><p class="c1"><span>liked</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>better</span><span class="c0">. Then he caught me by the shoulder and put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me in the corner with a long hard sum to do on my slate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The same with Michael. When I had finished I saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael making a sign to me that his sum was beyond</span></p><p class="c1"><span>him. The devil, said I to myself, I will give you </span><span>succour</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by hook or by crook. When the master strolled out as far</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as the ditch I darted across and handed Michael my slate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take mine,&rdquo; said I, seizing his. I was scarcely back in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my corner when the master returned. I had only finished</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael&rsquo;s sum when he came across to me, scowling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you done it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have, master,&rdquo; said I, handing him the slate.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He didn&rsquo;t say a word and it seemed to me he wasn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">too pleased that I had been able to do it. He went over</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to Michael, </span><span>and his of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;course was done too.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When all the others went home we were kept in, &lsquo;The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>door</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was locked as though we were in prison. Michael</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">began telling me of all the ghosts that had ever been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seen in it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whist,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it easy for us to get out through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the window?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>We climbed out and </span><span>away home</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day was Saturday and no school, so my heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was in my mouth for joy and delight. I walked out on to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the ditch. There was a fine burst of sunshine, my feet up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the ditch and I considering where I would turn my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">face.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw Shaun Fada coming towards me, the old man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the loud voice,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a fine day, Shaun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t a day like it this year, praise and thanks</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the King of Glory!

Then we turned our faces towards the cliff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Toms was down before me leaping as light as a goat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the screes, and no wonder, for it is amongst them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he had spent his life. &ldquo;Take it fine and easy,&rdquo; he said to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me, &ldquo;for fear your foot would loosen a stone and hit me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the head as it went down the hill. It is then you would</span></p><p class="c1"><span>be raising a </span><span>clamour</span><span class="c0">, Maurice, when you would see me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">falling over the cliff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be talking that way, Tomas. You make me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shiver.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A cold sweat was coming out on me with the eeriness of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the place. I stopped and looked up. When I saw the black</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rugged cliff standing straight above I began to tremble</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">still more. I looked down, and there was nothing below</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me but the blue depth of the sea: &ldquo;God of Virtues!&rdquo; I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cried, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it a dangerous place I am in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could see Tomas still climbing down like a goat,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>without </span><span>a trouble</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;or care in the world. There was a great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">din in the gully, it shining white with the droppings of</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the sea-birds&mdash;kittiwakes, herring-gulls, puffins, </span><span>guille</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mots, sea-ravens, razor-bills, black-backed gulls and petrels</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;each with its own cry and its own nest built in the rock.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was looking at them and watching them until before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long the dizziness left me, while I thought what a hard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">life they had, foraging for food like any sinner.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was thinking, I saw a puffin making straight</span></p><p class="c1"><span>towards </span><span>me in from</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the sea. It was quite near me now,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I saw that it had a bundle of sprats across its mouth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It came nearer and nearer until it was only five yards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away. It was likely going to land on the rock, I thought,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so I lay down in the long heather which was growing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around. It came in fearlessly and I made a grab at it with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my hand. But it had gone into a burrow beside me. &lsquo;The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>entrance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was covered with bird dung. I began digging it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out, and it was easy enough, for I had only to thrust my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hand back and lift up the ledge of a stone. There was a</span></p><p class="c1"><span>fine</span><span>&nbsp;fat </span><span>whippeen</span><span class="c0">? in it. I thrust my hand in to draw it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out, but, if so, I wished I had not, for it gave me a savage</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bite with its beak. When I caught it by the throat it dug</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">its claws into me so that my hand was streaming with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blood. At last I drew it out and killed it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I arose and looked down. Tomas was nowhere to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tomas,&rdquo; I cried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tomas,&rdquo; said the echo, answering me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; came up from Tomas far below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; repeated the echo, the way you would swear</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by the book there were four of us on the cliff. It seemed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to me that he was miles below me. God of Virtues, said</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Young puffin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I to myself, he will fall over the cliff as sure as I live. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>will</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;go no farther myself anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was wandering backwards and forwards among the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">screes until I came across another burrow with dung at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">its mouth. Faith, I have another, said I, taking courage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I began to dig. Soon I had drawn out a fine fat puffin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the end of my wanderings I had three dozen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was now the happiest hunter on the hills of Kerry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sat down on a stone and drew out the bundle of bread</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had brought with me for the day. I ate it hungrily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>When I got up and looked at the </span><span>whippeens</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thrown in a heap in the hollow beside me, I wondered</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how I would carry them home. Then I remembered I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had a rope round my waist. Untying it, I took hold of a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dozen of the birds, put their heads together and tied up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the dozen in a single knot. I did the same with the second</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dozen and the third, till I had them all on the rope.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sun was now as round as a plate beyond the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Teeracht to the west, and a path of glittering golden</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">light stretching as far as the horizon over the sea. I looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down, but Tomas was not coming yet, for he was a man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who never showed haste or hurry so long as plunder was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to be had. I gave a whistle. The echo answered me as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before. Soon after I heard him shouting, &ldquo;I am com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hundreds of birds were flying round, rabbits leaping</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from one clump of thrift to another, a sweet smell from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the white heather and the fern, big vessels far out on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">horizon you would think were on fire in the sunlight, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heat haze here and there in the ravines, and Kerry dia-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>monds</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lying all around weakening my eyes with their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sparkle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now I could see Tomas climbing slowly up, his face</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dirty and smeared with earth and no jersey on him. I</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">laughed aloud when I saw the look of him. He was climb-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing from ledge to ledge till he was within a few yards of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me. He had taken off his jersey, tied a cord round the neck</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of it and thrown it over his back with whatever booty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he had inside it. Coming up to me he put down the jersey</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">carefully on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The devil </span><span>take</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you, Tomas, what have you got?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have guillemots&rsquo; eggs, razor-bills&rsquo; eggs and sea-gulls&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eggs, my boy,&rdquo; said he, wiping the sweat from his fore-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head with his cap.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God, you have done well!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your soul to the devil, why didn&rsquo;t you come down,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man, and we would have had twice as many?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was too frightened,&rdquo; said I, pretending I had got</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no plunder myself. &ldquo;I dare say it is as well for us to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">starting now.&rdquo; And going across to my bundle I threw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it over my back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What </span><span>have</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>you there</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Puffins in plenty.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Here </span><span>in the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>scree</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;without stirring out of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God, you are the best hunter I ever met.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were moving on now up to the head of the cliff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went on from ledge to ledge and from clump to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clump.

Did you hear of any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curragh to be going in for it?&rdquo; asked Shaun, turning to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the King.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Indeed there are&mdash;a curragh from the </span><span>Cooas</span><span class="c0">, one from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ballymore and another from Leitri&uacute;ch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was now no talk in the village of anything else</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but the races. Everyone I met on road, hill, or strand, his</span></p><p class="c1"><span>first</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;greeting was &ldquo;Are you going to the races?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Are you?&rdquo; &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the Saturday night before they took place the boys</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and girls were gathered in together gossiping about the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">morrow. I met Tomas Owen Vaun. &ldquo;The devil, Tomas,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what about going to the races?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil, let us go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Does your father know?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, I told him today I was going and all I got</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a clout on the back which threw me out on my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is the same with me, but we will creep out unknown</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to them.

I said nothing but sat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by the fire, with a lip on me. Eileen was running around</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in a flutter. She came up and took the iron from the fire.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go to bed now,&rdquo; said she to me, &lsquo;and have the kettle</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">boiling for us in the morning.&rdquo; She annoyed me so that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave her a slap on the cheek. Then I ran down to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">room and went to bed. But, believe me, my two eyes never</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">closed. I lay listening to the tick-tock, tick-tock of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clock all night long till it struck five.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got up unknown to the others, washed and dressed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself, and an egg would not have broken under my feet</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the lightness of my tread for fear I might be heard on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the floor. I made the fire and put on the kettle. Then I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">put my head out through the door, and indeed it would</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have raised the dead from their graves&mdash;an edge of golden</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cloud over Mount Eagle from the sun that was climbing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the east, a calm on the sea, not a stain in the sky and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the lark singing sweetly above my head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I had eaten my bread and tea I went off for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tomas and found him ready before me. &ldquo;Shaun Tigue</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and Shaun Tomas are gone down to the quay. Hurry</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on and they will take us out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had the curragh afloat. &lsquo;Hurry, hurry,&rdquo; I cried,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;or they will be gone.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We raced down the slip. &ldquo;Shaun, will you take usr&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where are </span><span>ye going</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To the races.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well, jump in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In we leapt, joy in our hearts, the two of us seated in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the stern, the happiest creatures on the earth of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">world. When we were a little distance out from the quay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back at the village and saw the boys and girls</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking down. &ldquo;Look, Tomas, what good luck we had to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">leave the quay in time!&rdquo; Laughing, he gave me a pinch in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the thigh. &ldquo;&ldquo;Musha, it&rsquo;s true. If we were on the quay now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we would never get away.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The sea was like a pane of glass, a stream of ebbing tide</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out through the Sound to the north, guillemots, razor-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bills and petrels on the water, the four men stripped to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their shirts rowing hard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun Tigue spoke out in the bows, &lsquo;Do you see the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">loon?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We looked south and saw a big, white-breasted bird</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">floating down with the tide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a fine bird, Tom&aacute;s?

It was a low ebb-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tide. &ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said Shamus, &ldquo;we&#39;ll have great work tak-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ing the curragh </span><span>upon to the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;shore.&rdquo; Everyone took off his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shoes and drew his trousers up over his knees. Leaping</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out, we drew the boat up through the stones till we had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her above high-water. As soon as we found ourselves on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dry land, Tomas and I ran up the Cliff and made neither</span></p><p class="c1"><span>stop </span><span>nor</span><span>&nbsp;stay till we </span><span>reached</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the chapel in Bally-na-houn.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We sat down to wait for Mass, very shy, for we knew no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one in the place. &ldquo;The devil, isn&rsquo;t there a great difference</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">between this place and the Island?&rdquo; said Tomas. It was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his first day on the mainland and it was a great wonder to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When the priest arrived we went into the chapel. As</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we went down on our knees Tomas whispered to me:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t it a big house! How was it built at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whist,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or the priest will hear you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon he was prodding me again. &ldquo;Oh, I&#39;ll be killed, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father is down behind and he looking at me,&rdquo; he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whispered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I glanced back and saw my brother Shaun shaking his</span></p><p class="c1"><span>fist at me. &ldquo;Oh, they will kill us,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind.

Then we crept along</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">slowly till we were near the door. As soon as Mass was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over we ran out and up through the fields to the Hill of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clasach.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day was very sultry.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil, Tomas, let us throw off our shoes and we&#39;ll</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be as light as a starling for the road.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A great thought,&rdquo; said he, and we sat down on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roadside.

What sport we would have climbing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the top of it every evening after school! I wonder what</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is the name of it!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&#39;t you know it and you looking at it every day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the Blasket?

My people were living at that time in Cooan.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Do you see that place to the south?&rdquo;&rsquo; I said, pointing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards it. &ldquo;Well, that is where I would be today only</span></p><p class="c1"><span>for my great-grandfather </span><span>going</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the Island.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wasn&#39;t he a strange man to go there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, what could the poor people do at that time when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the rotten landlords threw out all the tenants at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cooan and scattered them like little birds? However, that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is not the story I have to tell you, but about my great-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather.

He would stick his head up and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">put out his tongue. Then someone threw one of the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blocks, two of them, three, but did not hit him. Another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man was attending the crowd, shouting, and neither of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them with a word of Irish. &ldquo;Hurray, hurray, here is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sammy in the Barrel willing to keep his head for any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man.

I gave the other half to Tomas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had eaten our fill, we set off again but we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were hardly outside the door when we were caught from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">behind and dragged back to the middle of the floor. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked up to see Padrig Eamonn with a grip of me and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his wife with a grip of Tomas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What devil or demon brought ye in here to take off</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that loaf of bread?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, hold your hand, strong man,&rdquo; said I, for Padrig</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a big giant of a man and he was looking vicious.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With those words he let me go and looked at me be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tween the eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are from the Island,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and when it goes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hard with the hag she must run, and that is the way we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were with the loaf, for we did not taste a bite of food</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">since we left home at the chirp of the sparrow. So as we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came up the Clasach our guts were twisted together with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hunger and faintness.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, God help ye,&rdquo; said Padrig, looking pitifully at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us now. &ldquo;Go out, Kate, and bring in a tin of milk. That</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is the best for them. I thought at first ye were lads from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this parish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kate went out with a can in her hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tomas and I were seated on two chairs still biting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lumps out of the loaf. Padrig was talking to us, but I tell</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you it was little desire we had for talk. &ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he, &ldquo;till you get the milk.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kate came back and handed me a big saucepan and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another to Tomas. Padrig was questioning us about the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">races, but it was little heed we gave him with our greed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the food and drink. When we had the loaf finished</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we would have liked another, but we had already taken</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">too much and so who would have had courage to ask</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for more. I tried to ask for another but something spoke</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">inside my heart, saying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask.

The sun had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gone down in the west after bidding farewell to the big</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">world, sheep-shearings in the sky overhead, the old men</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the parish stretched out on the top of the cliff giving</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their breasts to the fragrant sea air and talking together</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after the day, a heat-haze here and there in the bosom</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the hills moving slowly among the valleys, a colt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whinnying now and then and asses braying.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we reached the top of the cliff we met Shamus Beg.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;God save you, Shamus,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God and Mary save ye, my treasures,&rdquo; said Shamus</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Beg softly. &ldquo;Where </span><span>were ye</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>since morning</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;At the races, Shamus.

And when the people heard the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>clamour</span><span class="c0">, not a man, woman, or child but came out from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their houses. We burst into laughter to see them. They</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crowded down to the quay. We moved into the pool,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Maurice shouting &ldquo;Up Cooas!

The sun was splitting the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stones with its heat and the grass burnt to the roots. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see, far away to the south, Iveragh painted in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">many colours by the sun. South-west were the Skelligs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glistening white and the sea around them dotted with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fishing-boats from England.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a fine healthy life those fishermen have,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">daddo?&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got no answer. Turning round I saw that the old</span></p><p class="c1"><span>man</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was asleep. I looked at him, thinking. You were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one day in the flower of youth, said I in my own mind,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but, my sorrow, the skin of your brow is wrinkled now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the hair on your head is grey. You are without</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">suppleness in your limbs and without pleasure in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grand view to be seen from this hill. But, alas, if I live,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>some day</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I will be as you are now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The heat was very great, and so I thought of waking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">him for fear the sun would kill him.

He opened his eyes and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked round.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Mirrisheen +,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I fell asleep.

The third succeeds in getting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a bite. So they go on till the apples are all eaten, Then</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another game begins. There is a big bowl of water at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the fireside and they are roasting beans.

There was a light breeze from the east, rooks</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in plenty flying overhead and a fine settled look on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wonder would you care to go west with me to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inish?&rdquo; said Padrig.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your soul to the devil, come!&rdquo; said I with delight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha,&rdquo; said he, looking out to the south-east. &ldquo;I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have some fine new pots in the sea still and if I had them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ashore they would serve me another year.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, it&rsquo;s not better for us to be in,&rdquo; said Michael,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Get ready so,&rdquo; said Padrig, and Michael and I went</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to get provisions for the journey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I snatched a chunk of bread and hurried back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael was coming down the path, his cap on one side</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his head, a pipe in his mouth and the smoke going up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the air, his shoulders stooping and the stones ringing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the nails on his boots.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said he as he came down, &ldquo;it will make a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">great day.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The curragh was afloat, each of us with his dog who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knew well he was going hunting. As soon as the boat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">touched the water they leapt in, wagging their tails, their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tongues out and barking to each other like any three</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">men who would be talking together. We put our gear</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">aboard and moved out along the coast of the Island to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the west.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we were making Hill Head we got a nice breeze of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wind from the east. When we were far enough out we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drew up the sail, and out she moved swiftly. We were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very comfortable, plenty of tobacco from Padrig,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretched out at our ease and Michacl telling us the story</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Robinson Crusoe. We listened intently, and so we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were shortening the journey little by little.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I suppose we are not half-way yet, Padrig,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far now, as soon as the Teeracht is visible be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yond Black Head. Go on, Michael.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Teeracht came into sight. We had a beautiful</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">view as we crossed the Great Sound. I could see the little</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">white buildings up in the Teeracht and the shining white</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">road built through the black rocks from the sea all the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way to the lighthouse. To the south were the two Skelligs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bathed in sunshine, the sea full of all kinds of sea-birds,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the waves murmuring around us, Inish-vick-ilaun and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inish-na-Br&eacute; growing bigger and bigger as we approached</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them, a group of sheep here and there on the top of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inish-na-Br&eacute; and others down in the steep, dizzy cliffs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How fearless they are, I thought, missing a good deal of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the life of Robinson Crusoe on account of the beauty of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the place and the depth of my thoughts.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long we saw the house on the Inish, its felt roof</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glittering in the sunlight and fine green fields around it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Farther to the west I saw a flock of goats and I thought</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Robinson and of the goats he came across on an island</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">just like this. Hundreds and thousands of birds were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around, some of them flying through the air, others float-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing on the water, others settled on the rocks. I did not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know what Michael was saying with all the thoughts that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were running through my mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were alongside the island now and I got the sweet</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">smell of the fern, which grew to the height of a man. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;longing to go ashore. Padrig lifted his cap and looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around thinking. &ldquo;The first thing we had better do is to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">get the pots, for it is low tide now and we won&#39;t be long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">getting them if they are to be found at all. Then we can</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spend the day as we please!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We rowed south to the bottom of the Carhach.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take it easy now,&rdquo; said Pddrig, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a pot here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned the curragh round on the pot, and he drew</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where does the next pot lie, Padrig?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We will go south to the Moon Cave. There should</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be another there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We rowed on to the south till Padrig told us to stop.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked in and saw a pot between me and the cave. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">backed in. Padrig got hold of the cork and began to draw.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why is that cave called the Moon Cave, Padrig?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will tell you. Do you see the way its mouth is turned</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">south-east? Well, there isn&rsquo;t another cave in the island</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that faces in that direction, and when the moon does be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rising over Iveragh she throws a fine light straight into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">its mouth.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went on from one pot to another till at last we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had five of them and I learned the name of each place</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from Padrig. We went west to Merchants&rsquo; Gully, across.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the mouth of Bird Cove, all around the Thunder Rock,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till we reached Gulls&rsquo; Point. There we found another pot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig was drawing it in, in a leisurely way, while he told</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us of the time when he was a child growing up in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Inish. Suddenly he stopped talking and looked up at a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big high rock broken off from the island and about forty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">feet above the sea. I looked at him and could see that</span></p><p class="c1"><span>something was </span><span>astonishing him</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you see above?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I swear by the devil I see the queerest thing I ever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw.&rdquo; He was peering intently.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said Michael.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the man seated above with a hard hat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on him looking out to the Skellig?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked up. There he was, clearly visible, his knees</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">crossed. Nobody spoke. Who could it be? There was no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one living in the Inish, and even if there were, how could</span></p><p class="c1"><span>he get</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;out on that rock?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, Padrig, he is there without a doubt and, if so,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he is not of this world.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Michael looked at me and turned pale. I felt a shiver</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in my blood and a cold sweat came out on me. Then I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>thought</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I saw a mischievous look on Padrig. I began to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">think. At last I remembered my grandfather telling me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">once of a certain rock to be seen in the Inish which was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">called Micky the Pillar. It looked from the sea for all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the world like a man in a hard hat. &ldquo;Your soul to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">devil, isn&rsquo;t that Micky the Pillar?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig laughed. &ldquo;Upon my word, it gave the two of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you a good fright.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;it is no laughing matter. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;terrified when I saw it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are not the first,&rdquo; said Padrig, sitting on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thwart. &ldquo;But this won&rsquo;t do, my boys,&rdquo; he said, putting out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an oar. &ldquo;We are letting the day pass and doing nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We will go west through the Sound of Mantle Island and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then make for the Strand.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly Pddrig stopped rowing and stood up. &ldquo;I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">swear by the devil those are tame geese in on the rocks,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>said </span><span>he pointing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in-shore. &ldquo;What would bring tame geese</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here?&rdquo; said Michael. &lsquo;On my oath, a storm would,&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He took in his oars and remained standing in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curragh till we were close upon them. &ldquo;Easy now,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he, &ldquo;for fear they would fly.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We counted nine of them. We backed her in, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig had hardly stepped out of the boat when every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of them leapt into the air and flew out into the bay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">between us and the Skellig. We kept our eyes on them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">until they settled on the water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back her, back her,&rdquo; shouted Padrig. &ldquo;Get outside</span></p><p class="c1"><span>them and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;we shall round them in before us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was not long before we had rounded them in, ever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and ever, until they swam into Yellow Beach and climbed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up on to the rocks. Padrig leapt out after them but they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all flew off again except one which he caught. &ldquo;Och, devil</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take them, they are long on the sea. Look,&rdquo; said he, lift-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing up the goose, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s not a feather&rsquo;s weight in it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He crossed its two wings and threw it into the stern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off we went again, blind with sweat, till we had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rounded in the other birds. At last we had six of them,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and indeed the evening was now growing late for a star</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was to be seen here and there in the sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went south through the Narrow Sound and then</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">east alongside Inish-na-Br&eacute;. There was not a breath in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sky, glug-glug, glug-glug, from the falling tide out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the Sound to the south, sea-birds in thousands</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the water, porpoises diving in and out between each</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">other on the edges of the tide, a patch of mackerel here</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and there, a white path of foam in the wake of the cur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ragh</span><span class="c0">, a bright shining fish taking a leap into the air with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the fineness of the evening.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we were about twenty yards from the Laoch</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reef I got a very nasty smell. &ldquo;Poof, poof!&rdquo; I cried, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it was going through the back of my head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, don&rsquo;t you get the smell?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had hardly finished speaking when Michael and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig cried together: &ldquo;Poof, poof!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment I happened to glance out between me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and Iveragh and about ten yards to the south I saw rings</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the sea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what is that out there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig gave a shout. &ldquo;Your soul to the devil, it&#39;s a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shark, and it is from it we are getting the smell. Row,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">row as hard as you can and make for land.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We pulled out, none of us speaking a word. There was</span></p><p class="c1"><span>nothing to be heard but the </span><span>panting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the crew and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thud of the curragh leaping across a wave and the splash</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">under her bow when she sent up a spurt of foam. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were pulling hard but had not gone far when the shark</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">arose alongside the curragh&mdash;the biggest animal I ever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw, as long as a ship. You could see clearly its big blue</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gullet which could swallow three curraghs without any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trouble. We were in great danger&mdash;out in the middle of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Great Sound, a couple of miles from land and that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">savage, ravenous, long-toothed monster up beside us, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way it had only to turn its head and swallow us up. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought that at any moment we might be down in its</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">belly. We were still pulling with all our strength, strain-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing every sinew, the beast rolling along beside us, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from time to time giving us a side glance out of his two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blue eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It will sink us if it moves across below the curragh,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said Pddrig breathlessly. &ldquo;Row on, we are not far from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">land now, with the help of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Our eyes and mouths were pouring sweat, our muscles</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bending with the strain, not a word spoken. I could hear</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the </span><span>panting</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the other two, the grating of the oars and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the splashing of the beast through the water which kept</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sending spurts of foam into the curragh. And all the time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the smell of its breath was affecting us. There was no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">escaping it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You had better not kill yourselves,&rdquo; said Padrig,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;whatever it may do with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had scarcely spoken when the shark turned straight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in towards the side of the boat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God have mercy on us, he has us now. Row! row!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What about throwing out one of the </span><span>dogs to it</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, devil, row, or it will get you instead of the dog.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By this time we were only ten yards from Black Head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We began to take heart when we found ourselves in-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shore, scraping the limpets from the rocks in our haste.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We rowed east till we went into the Cave of the Palm.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The shark came no farther. We stopped. We were un-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">able to speak. Our breath was gone and our mouths wide</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">open trying to fill our lungs.

The Wake</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About three o&rsquo;clock one morning I heard a knock at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who is there?&rdquo; called my grandfather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me,&rdquo; said the voice. &ldquo;Open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wonder, said I to myself, what that man wants at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this time of night? There must be something wrong for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">him to be out at such an untimely hour. Listening, I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard my grandfather opening the door. &lsquo;Is that you,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun?&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Shaun Liam.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My mother died half an hour ago, and I have come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to call Shaun Leesh to go with me to Dingle about the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, the blessing of grace with her soul,&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather. &ldquo;Isn&#39;t it quickly she went? Come in and sit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I heard what they were saying my blood turned,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed as if all who had ever died were outside the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">window and old Kate Liam among them. If a mouse or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even a beetle made the slightest stir, I thought it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she. Lifting up my head I looked out through the win-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>dow</span><span class="c0">. She seemed to be looking straight in at me. I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">getting worse. The night was as black as pitch. Musha,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun Liam, said I to myself, how did you find the cour-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">age to walk here from your own house and no one with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you at all?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two of them were sitting by the fire talking about</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old Kate, and if they were not praising her it is not day</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yet. Isn&rsquo;t it a strange thing that everyone who dies gets</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">great praise from people? I wondered why. Then a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought came into my mind. It is from fear. They are</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">afraid, if they abused the dead man, he would come be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fore them in the night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My thoughts were scattered by the sound of my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father rising from his chair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, Shaun,&rdquo; he was saying, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it quickly she went</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the end?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is the way with death,&rdquo; said Shaun. &ldquo;I dare say</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if we all knew our day there would be no knowing how</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it would be with us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said my grandfather. &ldquo;And indeed it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time for her to go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, I am thinking she was in and out of a hun-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dred.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word she was. How is the sea tonight,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is fine and soft.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I lay listening and thinking till I fell asleep. Then I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">woke up and listened to hear if they were still talking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I could hear nothing but the sound of the waves breaking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wearily below the house. Shaun was gone.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was seized again with a feeling of mystery and hid</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my head under the blanket. Then, however it happened,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I peeped out at the window. I </span><span>gave a start</span><span class="c0">. &lsquo;wo shining</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eyes were peering in at me. My blood turned as cold as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ice. The eyes were staring at me&mdash;old Kate&rsquo;s eyes. Wasn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it well</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I recognized them? And wasn&rsquo;t she come now to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take revenge on me for stealing her tobacco long ago</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when she could not run after me? But now she could</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">move like the wind. I tried to cry out. But my tongue</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">swelled in my mouth, while I could not take my eyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away from what was in the window.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last I let out a scream which put the whole house</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in confusion. My brother Shaun was in the bed next to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mine. He leapt up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look at the window!&rdquo; I cried.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather came in. &lsquo;&lsquo;Who screamed?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look at the window!&rdquo; said I again, my eyes still fixed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in terror on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, God help you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is it but the cat,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you silly creature!&rdquo; And he went up to the window to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drive it away. Then I saw that it was indeed my own cat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with its two ears cocked.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning was fine with a light easterly breeze</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a lonesome look on the village on account of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">corpse being laid out, everyone idle on such a day and no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">school. I looked up at the Clochereeny, the hill above the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">village, and it seemed as if there was a lonesome look on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the stones, on the sky, and on the sea. I saw an old woman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">approaching from the west, another approaching from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the east, all making for the house of the dead.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather looked out. &ldquo;Praise be to God on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">high,&rdquo; said he, raising his hat, &lsquo;&lsquo;the day is keeping fine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the sake of old Kate, dear God bless her soul.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is indeed, God be praised.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, Maurice, I thought you were a great soldier</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till last night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word, if you had been lying there thinking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of old Kate and had seen the two eyes in the window you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would have been in as bad a way as myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, would you believe that one night I was alone in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the house and I saw three people standing at the bedside</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and the three of them </span><span>dead for</span><span>&nbsp;three years </span><span>past</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And had you no fear?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not at all, no more than I have now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you recognized them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As well as when they were in the world, they talking</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and I </span><span>listening</span><span class="c0">, though I could not understand them.

When we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reached the door my grandfather stopped and spoke</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">softly to me: &ldquo;When you go in, take off your cap and go</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down on your knees beside the body and say a prayer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the soul of old Kate.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed as if I was inside a mill with the beating of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the blood in my head, and when I saw the change that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had come upon her, stretched out as straight as a candle</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and covered with a sheet, I thought she would rise up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather walked across the floor and went down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on his knees. From the doorway I stood watching him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God guide me aright, said I to myself, now is the time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for me to show courage.

Then I saw my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father getting up and I arose to my own feet with such a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rush that I nearly tripped him over.

I went down and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stood at the top, looking on. The curragh was below, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coffin, with yellow clasps, in the stern, and everybody</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with a mournful look. They lifted the coffin ashore and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">carried it up. You could see yourself reflected in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">polished grain of the wood. I saw the name inscribed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on a yellow clasp: &ldquo;Mrs, Kate Coyne, born May end,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1833, died November 1913.&rdquo; Musha, said I to myself, I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don&rsquo;t know in the world why they make it so fine, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in three days&rsquo; time it will be deep in the clay. How strange</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are the ways of the world!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next load to be brought out was a barrel of porter,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">then a big rough pack of bread and two boxes full of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipes. Four men were shouldering the barrel and whisper-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing that it would make a fine night&rsquo;s wake. Four more</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were under the coffin, all making their way up the path.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the top I met my grandfather,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;You are looking sorrowful, daddo,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way with the old, my lad, for I have one foot</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the grave and the other on its edge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I noticed that the four men carrying the coffin were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">taking a very roundabout way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they go straight up the path, daddo?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it is not right to take</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a short road with the coffin to the house of the dead nor</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yet with the corpse to the grave?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went home. My grandfather sat down, took out his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipe, and laid his hat on his knee. &ldquo;Musha, dear God</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bless her soul,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she was a kindly, generous,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">warm-hearted woman in her prime.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;I am thinking she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would get praise now she is dead, whatever she was.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; said he, thrusting his pipe under a red</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sod of turf, &ldquo;but Kate Liam deserved praise from my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knowledge of her, though it is true that the proverb can-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not be gainsaid: If you wish praise die, if you wish blame</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">marry.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, daddo, I never heard that till now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, mo I&eacute;ir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have many things still</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to learn.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Shall we go to the wake?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We will spend part of the night there,&rdquo; said he with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a glance at the clock. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of what hap-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pened at a wake in the parish of Ventry long ago? &lsquo;There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a woman of that parish living alone of whom it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span>rumoured</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that she had plenty of money. Well, when her</span></p><p class="c1"><span>last</span><span>&nbsp;sickness struck her </span><span>down she</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sent for the priest. He</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came and put the holy oil on her. As he was leaving the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house she called him back: &lsquo;Musha, father, for the sake</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of God and the Virgin Mary, would you give me a few</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pence to wet my heart?&rsquo; The priest gave her sixpence</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and departed. The old woman died that very same night,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and on the morrow, when the neighbour women were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">preparing the corpse, one of them found a hard twisted</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lump in her hair behind her head. It was a purse with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">five pounds in it. They agreed to take it to the priest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ails ye now?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Musha, it&rsquo;s like this,&rsquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the best talker of the women, telling him the story. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>priest</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;drew back as pale as death. &lsquo;Oh, oh,&rsquo; he cried,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beating his hand against his breast, &lsquo;after asking me for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as much as would wet her heart! Go back with the money</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to her own house,&rsquo; said he, his voice trembling, &lsquo;and make</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no delay till you throw it in the fire. Bad luck will come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to anyone who keeps it.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They returned and did as the priest told them. When</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night came there were many at the wake, talking and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>conversing </span><span>of the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;old woman&rsquo;s money. At twelve o&#39;clock</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there came in through the door a fine, spirited, well-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">favoured man. Everyone looked at him, whispering who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he might be. He walked over to the corpse and it seemed</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to the people he was talking </span><span>softly</span><span class="c0">. He took out of his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pocket a fine white handkerchief. Everyone was watching</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in silence. He placed the handkerchief under the chin</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the corpse and the dead woman put out the Holy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Communion she had taken the day before. Then he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">folded up the handkerchief and departed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God keep us, daddo, the people in the house must</span></p><p class="c1"><span>have</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>been</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;horrified.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They were. When they saw the portent, some of them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ran out of the house in fear; but most remained, talking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eagerly, some saying that the woman was damned and it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the God of Glory who had come in&mdash;everyone with</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his own opinion. An hour later the door opened again</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and there entered a ragged, ugly man, unshaved and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>unwashed, with his toes out through his shoes. &lsquo;The </span><span>peo</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ple sat wide-eyed in wonder. He walked over to the body,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">put his hands round it and carried it off. And from that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">day to this no one has ever set eyes on that corpse or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard news of it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It is </span><span>likely it was the</span><span>&nbsp;old fellow carried it off,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who else! God between us and evil,&rdquo; said my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father, lighting his pipe from the ashes. He got up and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked at the clock. I dare say it is time for us to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making for the house of the wake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, walking to the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait now, Maurice, till I fill my pipe and we will be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moving off, in the name of God.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked out towards Dunquin. The moon was high</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the sky and the night very bright. I thought I saw a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curragh making for the quay.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Daddo,&rdquo; said I, calling in to him, &ldquo;there is a curragh</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">come in since, whoever they are.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, didn&rsquo;t you see the barrel coming in today?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he, scraping out his pipe with his knife. &ldquo;As sure as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am here I know those four men, for there is ne&rsquo;er a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wake with drink in it but those four will be there&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shamus Brack, the Tailor of Clasach, Yellow Donal, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun Egan,&rdquo; kneeling down before the fire to light his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipe. &ldquo;Come on now to the house of the wake.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The house was full from end to end, a blaze of light</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the candles on the table and a white lamp from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roof. If a pin had fallen from the rafters it must have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fallen on somebody&#39;s head&mdash;a group of old women at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fire, the Puincan at the head of the table cutting tobacco,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaun Fada filling the pipes, everyone, young and old,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">smoking, conversing, and talking of old Kate. As soon as</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a man finished his pipe, he handed it back to Shaun to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">get it filled again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather put a whisper in my ear: &ldquo;How are</span></p><p class="c1"><span>you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pleased with the night?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Delightfully,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In came the four strangers from Dunquin, looking shy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seats were found for them. &ldquo;What did I tell your&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my grandfather, nudging me. The barrel was opened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A bucket was handed round.

A pint was poured for Shaun Egan, the first of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them. He made no stop till he had swallowed it down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment the dead woman&rsquo;s son, Shaun Liam,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came across to my grandfather. &ldquo;Come up to the room,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We followed him, and it was there the goat was roast-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing as for stout lumps of old women with pipes as long as</span></p><p class="c1"><span>a </span><span>bandle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in their mouths.

I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">threw myself among my equals, but I soon grew sick of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their senseless chatter. I liked better the conversation of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the old and that has been the way with me always, so I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went up to the room again where I found the others as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while my grandfather got up and looked out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the window. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the day is dawn-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing.

Every time he swooped the chick would dive</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and go astray on him; and every time the chick came up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again, the gull would make another swoop.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, isn&#39;t the gull a treacherous bird?&rdquo; said PAdrig</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O&rsquo;&#39;Dala.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Paddy Tim. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it trying to fill his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">belly he is, and isn&rsquo;t it the same thing you are trying to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do yourself with the pollock on the Wild Bank to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">south?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, that&rsquo;s talk in the air,&rdquo; said Padrig.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why so? Isn&rsquo;t the guillemot herself watching for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">something to put in her belly and isn&rsquo;t it the same way</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the gull? Upon my word, I see no more treachery</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in him than there is in yourself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was not giving much ear to their talk but watching</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the gull swooping down, and the poor mother doing her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">best to defend her own. In the end the gull made another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">swoop and caught the chick by the tail, With that the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mother flew at him, and you never saw such a tussle as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there was between the two birds until at last the gull had</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to let go. Then the chick dived </span><span>under water</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mother after it. Faith, thought I, they are after making a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fool of the gull. And away he flew west over the waves.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were making the Inish by this time and my heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beating like a watch with delight, for I was never yet up</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>in the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;island. &ldquo;It is growing late,&rdquo; said Padrig. &ldquo;The best</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing we can do is to go ashore for the night and we can</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rise with the sparrow&rsquo;s chirp in the morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked west towards the island. The sea was like glass</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for smoothness, little fish playing on the top of the water,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sun going down behind the Narrow Sound and throw-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing its golden beams on the Foze Rocks which looked like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a castle of gold on the horizon, shining with a super-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">natural light.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, Padrig,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it a beautiful sight that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is around and about us?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I swear,&rdquo; said he, turning to me with a laugh, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know is it on myself or not, but as soon as I clear the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Horse&rsquo;s Mouth westward it seems as if a cloud rises from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my heart. Maybe it is because I was born in the Inish.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In my opinion,&rdquo; said Paddy, &ldquo;even if you were born</span></p><p class="c1"><span>above on the </span><span>Muilcheann</span><span class="c0">, you would love it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word was not out of his mouth when I heard from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the island a noise which took an echo out of the coves:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gurla-gu-hu-hu-golag&eacute;n! gurla-gu-hu-hu-golag&eacute;n!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart leapt, for it is often before I had heard that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spirits were to be seen and fairy music to be heard above</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the Inish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it, Padrig?&rdquo; said I tremulously.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Row on,&rdquo; said he with a laugh, &ldquo;and you will soon</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">see what it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We rowed on, our eyes on the strand, and soon we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard it again: Gurla-gu-hu-hu-golag&eacute;n!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look in now, and keep your eyes on the shingle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked in and what did I see but up to forty seals</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretched at full length, sunning themselves on the strand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig let out a roar. They raised their heads. Then away</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with them as hard as they could go to the water. Nota</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spot of the strand but was hidden by the spouts of foam</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they sent up into the sky; and when we were within ten</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yards of the strand, not a seal was to be seen, the sea still</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again, save only the rings they had left in their wake. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked down through the water. I could see the bottom</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clearly and the seals rushing out below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, Padrig, isn&rsquo;t it a marvellous speed they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is no wonder, my boy.

I looked up at the cliff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">above my head as is the habit of a stranger when he comes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to a foreign land. When we had the curragh on the stays</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and our gear in order for the night, I strolled away,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wandering, taking heed of everything around me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the course of my ramblings I found a black stone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and some old names cut into it. I could not count all that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were on it, but this is the one that put the greatest won-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">der on me: &ldquo;W, W. Wilson, Jan. 1630.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I called Padrig: &ldquo;Devil take it, would you believe there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is a name here which has been made for two hundred</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and eighty-four years?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, my pity for your head, did I not see a man from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dublin once who found a name above in the churchyard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which was made a thousand years ago?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Better still,&rdquo; said I, and at that moment a verse came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into my head and I recited it to Padrig:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The trout lives in the stream,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The duck lives on the pool,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The blossom lives on the tree,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But lives not the hand that wrote.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, my boy,&rdquo; said Padrig, looking at me between</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the eyes, &ldquo;there is a power of nonsense inside your head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We turned our faces up into the island and climbed an</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old path through the cliff. There was a beautiful view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Teeracht with its little white houses lay behind us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the north. Over in the west, nine miles away, were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Foze Rocks, and nothing to be seen beyond them but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sky like a great shining wall, and the sun descending</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big and round into the sea. Over to the east was the Bay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Dingle and a melancholy look coming over the hills</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the fall of night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We moved on together, up to our knees in the long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grass. Soon I saw the house above me at the foot of a little</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hill with fine fields around it. We had three dogs with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us, and with their ears cocked they ran off before us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the island. Hundreds of rabbits were to be seen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making hurriedly for the warrens, running past as thick</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as ants, ears back, tails up, and the eyes starting out of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their heads in terror of the dogs. In a few moments the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whole island was in confusion&mdash;the sheep running wild,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the goat fleeing for its life, the birds screaming across the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>fields northwards to the lonely reefs. </span><span>What wonder</span><span class="c0">! When</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did they last see a man of this world? I thought of Robin-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">son Crusoe when he landed on just such an island. What</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would he not have given to be a goat when he saw a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">herd of them running together and he without a com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">panion!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The delight in my heart was growing as I came nearer</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the mystery of the island. But I grew sad as I thought</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of all who had ever lived there, making a livelihood for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">themselves like the wild goats, and not one of them alive</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">today.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two of the dogs came running up to us, each with a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rabbit across his mouth. They threw them down at our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">feet, and then made off again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Padrig, aren&rsquo;t the dogs well taught?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said he, feeling the rabbits, &ldquo;there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is fat on these. Have you a knife?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I gave him mine and he soon had the guts out of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked on again but had not gone far when we saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the dogs running back with two more rabbits. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I, &ldquo;if they keep this up, we&#39;ll have spoils tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we came to the ditch of the field outside the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house, a start was taken out of me. I stopped and listened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I hear it, said I in my own mind, the sweetest music I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever heard. I heard it again. My heart leapt. &ldquo;Padrig!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I, &ldquo;do you hear anything?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at me and listened. &ldquo;I swear by the devil,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he, lifting his cap and scratching his head, &ldquo;that all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who ever died in the island are above in the house making</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sport.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did not doubt him on account of the reputation of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the place for fairies and a shudder ran up from my little</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">toe to the roots of my hair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Padrig looked at me again. He was smiling. &ldquo;Did you</span></p><p class="c1"><span>never </span><span>hear</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of a petrel?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I did not.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That is a petrel now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is inside the ditch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I listened again, and true enough for him I could hear</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it clearly now, the sweetest song ever heard by mortal</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ear. I would have spent the whole evening listening to it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but for Padrig making fun of me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went up to the house&mdash;a little, low hut with a felt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roof, ruins in plenty around, weeds and nettles growing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">among them. We went inside. It was nice and clean, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walls whitened with lime, and a little room below. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went down to the room, to see two rabbits scampering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away through a hole they had made in the wall. Padrig</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came down and threw a curse at them when he saw the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hole.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked up at the walls which were covered in cob-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">webs and a picture of Moses as black as soot. I took it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down, but could not read what was written on it. &ldquo;I sup-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>pose, Padrig, this </span><span>is here</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;since you were born?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is, and for ages before me. Let us go out now and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cut some fine dry fern for the night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not far from the house we came upon fern in plenty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">growing as high as ourselves. We began tearing it out,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and soon each of us had gathered the makings of a good</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bed. We left it to dry at the bottom of the house and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went in. One of us kindled a fire, another went to draw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">water, another swept out the floor&mdash;each at his own task.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I opened two of the rabbits and hung the other two out-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side the door on a nail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We soon got the look of a hearth on the place, the lamp</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">alight, a fine glowing fire put down and sending out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">warmth through the house. We sat down to dinner, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a savoury dinner it was&mdash;a fine stew of rabbits and plenty</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of soup.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had eaten our fill: &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said Padrig, &ldquo;I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had better go out now and lay twenty traps or so, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>maybe we will have another </span><span>dozen of rabbits</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In half an hour he was back again. &ldquo;It is as well for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us now to bring in the fern,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for we have need</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of a stretch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We soon had our beds made, each in his own corner,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and stretched ourselves out after the weariness of the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sleepy in the morning,&rdquo; said Padrig, &ldquo;for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quaybach ! is the very devil for the rabbits. Musha,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he again, stretched back contentedly in the fern with his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipe in his mouth, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s many the day I spent here in my</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>1Great</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;black-backed gull.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">youth with ne&rsquo;er a care nor a trouble in the world, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I tell you there was abundance here then as for milk in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plenty and butter. My father had twelve cows here at one</span></p><p class="c1"><span>time and it&rsquo;s </span><span>many the firkin</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;he sold at the market. But,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my sorrow! look at it today&mdash;nothing but ferns and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nettles.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long we fell asleep. About two o&#39;clock I awoke.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing but darkness and the sound of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>other</span><span>&nbsp;two </span><span>snoring</span><span class="c0">. I was seized with fear when I saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where I was, thinking of all I had ever heard about the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fairies. The moonlight was pouring through the window.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How envious I was of the other two snoring peacefully in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the dead of night! As I lay thinking, what did I see but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a human hand passing across the window and taking up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the two rabbits I had hung on the nail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt up and tried to scream, but the tongue swelled</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in my mouth. I could see him clearly now. He had a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">horn-peaked cap and the clothes of a sailor. I could hear</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his footsteps outside as he went away with the rabbits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;save me from the fairies!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got up somehow and went over to Padrig and gave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">him a kick which lifted him clean out of the fern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; said he, looking up in the moonlight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, oh, Padrig, it is someone I saw outside the window</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going off with the rabbits.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, my pity for your brass head,&rdquo; said he, stretch-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing back again into the fern,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I lay down once more and at last I fell into a light</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">doze.

We heard a cry</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from a gull, then another, as if they were closing around</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">something.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, bad cess to them, they have the rabbits eaten,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said PAdrig, leaping over a rock and I after him, ever and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever, till we came to the first trap where we found two of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them tearing a rabbit asunder. &ldquo;Hucs, hues, hucs!&rdquo; he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cried as he drew near them.

We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drew it out; then away with us as fast as we could by</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Rock&rsquo;s Foot to the east and then by the Spring</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meadow to the south, drawing one trap after another and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a rabbit in every one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Away with us again to Bird Cove in the west, till we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came to the head of the Cove, and there we heard the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">olag&eacute;n from the seals on the shingle below. Anyone who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had no knowledge of them would think that the living</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and dead were gathered there. We sat down for a while</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">listening, the moon shining in on us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wonder, Padrig,&rdquo; said I, his back to me, lighting his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipe, &ldquo;would you believe that those are men under</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">magic?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have heard it, and upon my word I would believe</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it for</span><span>&nbsp;they are just like old women </span><span>keening</span><span class="c0">.

Only that was not the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trouble, but the island was full of holes covered with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fern, the way it was often when I put out my foot I would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">go down a hole up to my hip and then away with me on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the crown of my head and the rabbits on top of me. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was blind out, down a hole and down a hole, till at last</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I became so out of </span><span>humour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I wished the island and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rabbits to the old fellow. I had no view of Padrig and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was drowned in sweat, and I did not know east from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">west. I sat down, dropped my pack of rabbits on a clump</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of grass, threw off my cap and wiped my brow. Well, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I to myself, I am alone at last, and I might as well have</span></p><p class="c1"><span>taken</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it softly from the beginning.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked round, There was nobody to me or from me,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I knew not on what side of the island I had stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was listening to the different cries of the birds and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watching the dew sparkling in the moonlight, rabbits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">darting by me to the east and to the west and making</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">black paths through the dew. Some lines of &ldquo;The Mid-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night Court&rdquo; came into my mind, and with the delight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in my heart I recited them aloud:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;*Twas my wont to wander beside the stream</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the soft green sward in the morning beam,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Where the woods lie thick on the mountain-side,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Without trouble or care what might </span><span>betide</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;*</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while I got up. I wonder am I long here, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">J. Padrig will think I have fallen over the cliff. I threw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my pack over my back. I looked east and I looked west.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>God </span><span>send</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me on the right road, I prayed. Where is the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>house now? And where is </span><span>Padrig</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Percy Usher&#39;s translation. &ldquo;The Midnight Court&rdquo; is a long poem</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by Brian Merriman, a Clare poet of the early nineteenth century.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went on among the rocks, stooping low and thinking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again of all who ever died in the island, and the more I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought the more afraid I became. Isn&rsquo;t it a strange thing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cannot think of anything else to scatter those terrible</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thoughts out of my mind? I would try and fail. I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glancing into every hollow in the rocks for fear there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would be anyone from the other world within. Then I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard a couple of coughs such as you might hear from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an old man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart leapt. I stopped. There I stood poised on one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">foot, like the man long ago when the wind and the sun</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tried to see who would strip the coat from him and he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing without a stir in the middle of the road. I re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mained in the same posture, my two eyes thrust into a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dark hole, for it seemed to me that it was out of that</span></p><p class="c1"><span>hole the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;coughing came. As I watched, a cold shiver ran</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through me the way I was trembling from head to heel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I heard the coughing again, loud and strong. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could stand it no longer and let out a roar. When the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing within heard me, out he came with a rush, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I saw the big white mass making towards me from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hole I let out one shout and fell out of my standing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the clump. Just as I fell I saw what it was&mdash;a big wether</span></p><p class="c1"><span>belonging to </span><span>Padrig</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>O&#39;Dala</span><span class="c0">, and away he went down the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hill at a gallop. &ldquo;Ah, musha,&rdquo; cried I when I got back</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my speech, &ldquo;may the big fellow take the head from your</span></p><p class="c1"><span>scroggle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;if it isn&rsquo;t fine the way you are after putting the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yellow terror on mel&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stood up and looked around. Look now, said I, woe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the man without patience. And it is my firm opinion</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that it is thus ghosts are made for many on this island,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for, for my own part, I have seen two apparitions in one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put my pack on my back again and off I went. I had</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>not</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>got</span><span>&nbsp;over my </span><span>fright</span><span class="c0">. I was still weak, but I swore to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself, whatever else I would see, it would not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trouble me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long I heard a hand-whistle, and my heart leapt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again. Listening carefully I heard another, nearer this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time, It is Padrig in search of myself, said I, putting a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">finger in my mouth and whistling in reply.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; called his voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am here,&rdquo; said I in the height of my head; &ldquo;where</span></p><p class="c1"><span>is yourself</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am at the Hollow of the Eagles,&rdquo; cried the voice.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, God be with me,&rdquo; said I, &lsquo;where is the Hollow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the Eagles?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shouted again: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s yourself?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The devil </span><span>I know</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;where I am,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I&#39;m going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">astray.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you see the Teeracht?&rdquo; he cried hoarsely.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I do not, but I see the Foze.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir, so, till I find you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sat down on a clump, exhausted.

I gave him a kick in the side. He leapt up, looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span>around, and rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;</span><span>Are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ye come since?&rdquo; says he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, aren&rsquo;t we after walking the four corners</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the island?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It must </span><span>be day</span><span class="c0">, so.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Padrig, &ldquo;but near it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put down a fire and went out to get water from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">well. The windows of the day were now opening in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">east, the moon sinking west of the Foze, and the red light</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of the sun rising over the </span><span>Macgillicuddy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Reeks and so</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">westward across the Bay of Dingle, the light of day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quenching the light of night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I returned home, put the water in the kettle, and hung</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it over the fire. Then the thought struck me to walk out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and see the churchyard. I had long wanted to see it and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>now</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was my time for it while the kettle was boiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was only three hundred yards from the house. I soon</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">found it, in nice order, and beside it an old chapel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing above the ruin was a cross, looking very ancient,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my hand&rsquo;s length of moss on every stone. Look how even</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the stone grows old! It is said that a priest is buried there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the time when there was persecution on the clergy,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">though there is a great change on the world today, praise</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on high to the Eternal Father!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a lovely morning; steam rising from grass and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fern as the sun drew up the dew; the goat, the sheep, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the birds stretching themselves after the sleep of night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I had examined the churchyard, I went into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chapel&mdash;four feet of a doorway going in and a place for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an altar in the wall made out of a fine, firm block of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stone. I noticed many names cut here and there into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stones. Everyone who had ever visited the place had left</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his name behind him. Among them I found some old</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">writing of which I could make nothing. I was working</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away at it and spending my mind on it when I heard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a hand-whistle.

I was rowing on slowly, ever and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever, till I saw clearly the Bank of the Gardens of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mouth across the White Cleft.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I with a shout of joy, &ldquo;put out the lines,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and, by God, it looks </span><span>like fish</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It did, too, at that time, with all the guillemots, razor-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bills, sea-ravens and kittiwakes dipping themselves in pur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">suit of fish, and now and then the leap of a pollock would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">send up a spurt of foam which sparkled in the sun the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>way</span><span>&nbsp;it would put stars </span><span>on my</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;eyes. Padrig stood up, drew</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out his pipe, and lighted it.

He was work-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing away at it, ever and ever, till at last we could see it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the water&mdash;a big, bright eel as long as the cur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ragh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil take you, Paddy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;have the hook</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ready for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Paddy Tim took up the hook, put it neatly into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gills and hauled in the eel.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith, it is a fine fish,&rdquo; said Pddrig, laughing for joy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It appears that the fish you would catch here is worth</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">calling a fish,&rdquo; said Paddy Tim.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment he got up quickly from the thwart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for there was another fish on his own line. He began</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to draw, a sharp look in his eye, for fear it would get</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Easy, Paddy!&rdquo; says Padrig. &ldquo;Back her, Maurice,&rdquo; says</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he again softly, the way you would think he was afraid</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to speak up lest the fish would hear him. Paddy was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drawing away and panting for breath, ever and ever,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till at last he landed it into the curragh&mdash;the finest pol-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lock I ever saw.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the end of all, the boat was down to the gunwale</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with fish. Then the tide turned and never a bite after</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it. So we turned our faces homewards, well satisfied with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hunting of the day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a nice puff of wind from the west. &ldquo;I sup-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pose the sail would take us east, Padrig?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No doubt. Why wouldn&rsquo;t it? Haul it up.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We took in the oars and I soon had the mast up and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">threw the jib-sheet to Paddy.

It was a comfortable time&mdash;the boat down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to gunwale with fine pollock, not a touch of stress on us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as we made for home, but the curragh moving east and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ploughing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the sea before her, we pulling at our pipes</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">and talking and discussing the affairs of the world.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XII.

The quay is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">full of wreck!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; he cried, the eyes starting out of his head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We both leapt into the air with delight. &ldquo;The devil,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tomas, come south to the Point!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hoo, hoo!&rdquo; he shouted, throwing his cap into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">air.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we reached the Point, there was not a child nor</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old woman in the village but were seated on their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">haunches on every stone looking out over the Bay of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dingle. The sea was fine and calm with a light breeze</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the south and white beams floating as far as you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see over the Bay. About twenty yards from the shore</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a plank of wood with hundreds of gulls settled on it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">picking the barnacles. Before long I noticed two of them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fighting fiercely, and soon, like any other crowd, one be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gan helping the other till they were all in the battle</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drifting north with the tide.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked south to the Skelligs and saw the curraghs</span></p><p class="c1"><span>making </span><span>for home</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;full of wreckage. We waited till they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reached the Point, when we all ran down towards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quay, like the gulls themselves, and had great enjoyment</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dragging the timber up the slip. Soon the light of day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was quenched and the wreck-gatherers had to put their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curraghs on the stays, well satisfied with the day&#39;s work</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and their bones aching after all the rowing since morn-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next day the quay and the strands were a grand sight,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big timbers lying here and there and not a curragh with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">less than a hundred planks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; one man would say, &ldquo;war is good.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;if it continues, this Island</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will be the Land of the Young.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The war changed people greatly. Idle loiterers who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">used to sleep it out till milking-time were now abroad</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the chirp of the sparrow gathering and ever gather-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ing. There was good living </span><span>in the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Island now. Money</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was piled up. There was no spending. Nothing was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bought. There was no need. It was to be had on the top</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the water&mdash;flour, meat, lard, petrol, wax, margarine,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wine in plenty, even shoes, stockings, and clothes. Not a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house in the Island but a storeroom was built beside it to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">keep the gatherings, and, without any exaggeration, when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you entered one of them you would think you were in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a big town, with all the barrels of flour piled on top of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one another, tins of petrol and every sort of riches; and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when the old man or the old woman came round, all they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had to do was to make for the barrels of wine and help</span></p><p class="c1"><span>themselves to a </span><span>draught</span><span class="c0">. Buyers were coming from all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">parts of Kerry to buy the wood, to buy the wax and every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sort of oil, so that money was being made rapidly. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is no doubt but a curragh can make a wonderful stand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in a foamy sea. For from my own knowledge I can say</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that from that time, though storms might come, she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would be out over the waves like a feather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One Friday the King had gone to Dunquin for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">post, and, as I have said already, the whole village, young</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and old, had to be on the quay to meet him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How is England doing, Padrig?&rsquo;&rdquo; asked the Puincdn,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when the letters had been given out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;it is likely the end of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">world is coming, for they are making no stop now and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">England is going to send out conscription through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whole of Ireland.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bad indeed so, bad indeed so,&rdquo; said the Puncan,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spitting tobacco.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s not the tidings we want,&rdquo; said another man,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;but did you hear of a ship being sunk in any place</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">since?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;one was sent down yester-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">day morning near Cork Harbour, the Lusitania, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">finest ship the Americans ever had. They say there were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">millionaires in plenty on board and isn&rsquo;t it a terrible</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing that not a sinner of them came ashore alive. If this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">breeze lasts from the south tonight, the coast of the Island</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will be full of drowned men tomorrow.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>No one went to sleep </span><span>in the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Island that night. Many</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;were out on the headlands, north, south, east, and west,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others up at cock-crow next morning in search of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">millionaires. It was a Saturday and there was no school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As soon as I got up I went south to the Point. It was a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine morning, not a puff in the sky. I sat on my heels and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">scanned every inch of the Bay. After about half an hour</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought I noticed something far out to sea. I could not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">make out what it was. I rubbed my eyes thinking it might</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be only a fancy, but then I saw it again and two sea-gulls</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">settled on it. Certain of my opinion now, I ran home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God, father,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I have seen something, what-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">, getting up. &ldquo;Go south again and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will call Mick&rdquo; (his brother).</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I darted back to the Point. When I got there I found</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Liam Tigue before me with a stoop on him, peering out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to sea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there any wreckage in the Bay, Liam?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed I think I see something between me and Slea</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Head,&rdquo; said he, pointing south-east. &ldquo;Look and see if you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could make out what it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;By God, Liam, </span><span>it is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;one of the millionaires.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As sure as I live,&rdquo; said he, getting up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked up to the ditch and Liam back towards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">village. With a glance down to the quay I saw my father</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and uncle putting out in the curragh and pulling hard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">past the Cliff Well to the south. When Liam saw them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">leaving the quay: &lsquo;You rogue,&rdquo; said he, coming back to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me, panting, &ldquo;it is well you knew your father was going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Is that my father?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">, mocking him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is, and well you knew it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father was near it now. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said Liam, &ldquo;it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a human being.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They drew alongside it. Then we saw the man in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stern leaping to the bows and the man in the bows leap-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing astern.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a human being, indeed,&rdquo; said Liam, &ldquo;and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man in the bows hasn&rsquo;t the courage to throw the rope</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">round it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They had it tied now and were turning home. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stayed as we were till they came towards the Point.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On my oath, Liam, it is a human body. Do you see it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing straight down in the water?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are right, for that is the lifebuoy under its head.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shortly afterwards, with a pull from the rope, the pale</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">face turned towards us in the sunlight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We ran down the quay. It was a terrible sight, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">THE WAR 147</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eyes plucked out by the gulls, the face swollen, and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clothes ready to burst with the swelling of the body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&#39;s that you had?&rdquo; said Eileen to my father when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;came home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A dead body.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what will you do with it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, we will bring it home,&rdquo; said he, smiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I went </span><span>out to the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;door. I saw a curragh making for</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the quay and I thought it was </span><span>peelers were in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. I ran</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back in excitement.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The peelers are come to the quay,&rdquo; I cried, and my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>father</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;got up from the table.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went to speak with the sergeant. It was arranged</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to take the body to Dunquin so that the peelers could</span></p><p class="c1"><span>take care of it till its </span><span>people would take</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. They went</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down to the quay and I slipped into the curragh&mdash;my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father, my uncle, and myself in one of them, and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">peelers in the curragh from Dunquin. When we reached</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Great Cliff, the body was taken out and stretched on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the quay. The sergeant began searching the pockets,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>all of us </span><span>looking</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on, but soon he drew back again. &lsquo;The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>smell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was too strong. No one had the courage to go</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">near it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But there was one old man called Mick of the Hill</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing beside us with his hands in his pockets, He</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walked up and stood over the body. He put a foot on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">each side of it, took his hands from his pockets, looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">first at us and then at the body. He went down on his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knees and began to open the coat. When he had the coat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and vest open, he put his hand in one of the pockets and,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drawing out a small diary, he handed it to the sergeant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was standing by. When he opened the book the first</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing I saw was the drowned man&rsquo;s name written like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Henry ATKINSON</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">3 Edward. Street, London, W.C.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">First-class Officer S.S. Lusitania.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the other pockets were found a watch and gold</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chain, a comb, a mirror, and three sixpences.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Keep the sixpences yourself,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have earned them well.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, God leave you your health, my son,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mick, putting them in his pocket.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all helped to carry the body to the top of the cliff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then they laid it in the sergeant&rsquo;s motor car and went off</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with it to Ballyferriter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I went out the next morning there was a light</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">swell on the rocks and you would think from the look of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sky and sea that a change was coming. I was sitting,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one foot up on the ditch, looking north and south, deep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in thought, when Tomas Owen Vaun came running</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">breathlessly towards me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Easy, Tomas!&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">, &ldquo;take it softly. I think, by the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>look </span><span>of you</span><span class="c0">, you have seen something.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it is not that, but Shaun Lane</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">has a big boat full of sailors!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, whist, don&rsquo;t be telling lies like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;The </span><span>devil a lie</span><span class="c0">. They are rounding Long-Rock Head</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with her.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He ran off without another word. Looking after him,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knew by the rush he was in he had spoken the truth. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ran into the house.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said I to my father and grandfather, who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were before the fire, &ldquo;Shaun Lane has a boat full of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sailors round Long-Rock Head!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who told you so?&rdquo; asked my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tomas Owen Vaun.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, Tomas is like yourself,&rdquo; said my grandfather,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rising from the chair and taking up the broom to sweep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the floor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I returned to the ditch and sat with my hand under my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chin, gazing steadily at the horizon in hope of seeing the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">boat on its way from the west. Before long I saw the bow</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of a curragh beyond the Spit and the men rowing hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I am thinking you were right about the boat, Tom&aacute;s,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I in my own mind. Just at that moment she came into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sight. She was full of people.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ran in again. &ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;the boat is round-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing the Spit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before you could clap your hands the news had gone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the village. Young and old were out on every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clump of grass, some of the children running into hiding</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for fear of them, others jumping for joy, old pensioners</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who had not been able to leave the chimney-corner creep-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing to the doors to see the sight. We ran down the quay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The whole village was there, and such a crush that some</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were up to their knees in the sea. But little they cared so</span></p><p class="c1"><span>long</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as they got a view of the sailors.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the boat came into the pool, the first thing we</span></p><p class="c1"><span>noticed was three</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;black men on board her. There was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another man, too, a Chinaman, with a small round face</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a snub nose, eyes like two pins and long black hair</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down his back. Some were singing, some asleep, others</span></p><p class="c1"><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;talking. You would think they were a flock of geese,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some speaking English, others Italian and I know not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what. &lsquo;They leapt out on to the slip, fifteen in all, some of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them strong, others unable to stand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One of them, standing just beside me, was over six</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">feet tall, with a long narrow face, a beard over his breast,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a big fat nose and two little black eyes under prominent</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">brows, a scarf twisted round his neck, a horn-peaked cap</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on his head and long boots up to his knees. I wonder, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I to myself, looking up at him, will I ask him where he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is from. I tried to speak but something came into my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">throat. I tried again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked down at me and laughed. Then he gave out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a great rush of talk. Another answered him, and indeed,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you would go anywhere to listen to them, though you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could not understand them. Then the last man to leave</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;boat spoke out and greeted the people in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My father spoke to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you are the captain?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I Am not, but </span><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mate.

We left Buenos Aires bound for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cork. When we were about twenty miles south-west of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Teeracht we met a submarine. It drew up alongside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The captain spoke, ordering us to take to the boats as he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was going to sink the ship. Five boats we had and we got</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them out as fast as we could. We were not far from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ship when the torpedo struck her and we saw her going</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down by the stern. Well, my good people, we are on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea ever since, for the weather was bad, and, what was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worse, we were scattered like the sons of Lir.t Och, it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a terrible destruction,&rdquo; he cried with tears in his eyes,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stretching his hands to the sky. &ldquo;I had three brothers in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the other boats and no news nor tidings of them since.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Reference to one of the legends. Lir, father of Manannan, was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the old Irish sea-god. He has drifted into English literature under</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the guise of Lear, while his son&rsquo;s name is preserved in that of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isle of Man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">THE WAR 151</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They are safe with the help of God,&rdquo; said my father;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;have no fear for them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But with regard to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the captain, there&rsquo;s no doubt he was a bad one. We had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no food in the boats but biscuits. He was giving us only</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one biscuit a day and no water at all. He was giving me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">enough, but I didn&rsquo;t like the way he was treating the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others. The crew rose against him. They told him three</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">times if he didn&rsquo;t give every man his right they would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">throw him overboard. And then,&rdquo; said the mate, &ldquo;do you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">see that big dark fellow over there?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil, my lad,&rdquo; said old Mickil, looking at him,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;that fellow has a bad look in his eye.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, that man got thirsty and asked the captain for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a drink.

In three</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hours, when they were all washed clean and shaved, with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an hour&rsquo;s sleep, you would think they were not the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">men, all but the three black men who were unchanged</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but for the shine on their faces after the washing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>They came down chattering to the quay, the whole </span><span>vil</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lage following them, for everyone was amazed at their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talk, and especially at the black men.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great God of Virtues,&rdquo; cried an old woman who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would not believe there were such people in the world,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;why wouldn&rsquo;t they clean themselves?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, Maura,&rdquo; said another woman, &ldquo;it is not dirty</span></p><p class="c1"><span>they are but black </span><span>from their birth</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, musha, my pity for you entirely, isn&rsquo;t it you who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">has the skull of a chicken to tell me there are people</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, Maura, don&rsquo;t be foolish.

Every curragh had an ax, and when they found</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a box too big to bring ashore they split it open on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spot, and when a seal would put up his head to take the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">air he would only have his snout out of water when he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would hear the blows and down he would dive again in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">alarm.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long we saw a curragh rounding the bottom of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well Point, followed by a boat in which were two sailors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We all made for the quay.

But, upon my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">word,&rdquo; said he, glancing around, &ldquo;you are here&mdash;fine, well-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">favoured people, mannerly, intelligent, generous, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hospitable.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the King, &ldquo;we are very thankful to you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the praise, But I promise you, since the war began, it</span></p><p class="c1"><span>is many a sailor</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>has</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;been saved here from the sea. And as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for attending them well, they get what we have. But you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">must be cold and wet standing there. Come up into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">village.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sailors spent two or three hours with us. When</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they had eaten and rested, they said farewell to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people of the Island and departed for the mainland.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that out there was plenty and abundance in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Island&mdash;food of all sorts, clothes from head to heel, every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man, woman, and child with a watch in their pockets;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not a penny leaving home; everything a mouth could ask</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for coming in with the tide from day to day&mdash;all except</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sugar which melted as soon as it touched water.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week later there came a heavy storm from the north-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">west and every sea-bank began to break and sweep foam</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up on the green grass, the waves thundering on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Strand, dogs howling at night on account of the gale, as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is their habit, a whirlwind whistling through every alley</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the way you would think it would snatch the roof from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the house. Everyone was waiting in expectancy, for there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was no telling what might come out of the ship if the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>storm</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;broke it up. They took little sleep, but spent their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time keeping a watch on the strands and the coves and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going into the hill to look down at the ship.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a Monday. Tomas and I were talking at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bottom of the lane with no thought of school but of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wreckage.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What would you say to going west to Shingle Strand,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I, &ldquo;to sce if there is anything thrown in?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Your soul to the devil, come on,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;eagerly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The gale was shrieking across the Pass of the Hill-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slope from the west. When we reached the Sandhills we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had to cling fast to each other to keep our feet. We went</span></p><p class="c1"><span>down towards the Strand. The din was terrible. An </span><span>enor</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mous wave would break in and sweep the shingle up to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the foot of the cliffs. Then it would churn up the stones as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it receded. We had to put our fingers in our ears to stop</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the noise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, Tomas, Let us not go down. We&#39;d be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drowned surely!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know where we&#39;ll go?

From time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to time a gust would throw us to the ground. &quot;I think,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said Tomas, &ldquo;&lsquo;we had better not trust ourselves out on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Spit.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The words were not out of his mouth when we were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">both covered in a spurt of foam which soaked us from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head to heel and sent us sprawling on the grass. We lay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there for several minutes before either of us could speak.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you, Tomas?&rdquo; I cried in the height of my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am here,&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I rubbed my eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I got up it seemed as if there were a ton weight in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my body with the water. &ldquo;Get up, Tomas,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fore we get the same again. It is lucky we were not to go</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">any farther for we would surely have been thrown from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the cliff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked up to Donlevy Spit. The sun was strong in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sky, so we stripped off every shred we had on, wrung</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the water out of our clothes and spread them out in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sunshine. Our teeth were chattering with the cold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was five o&#39;clock when we turned our faces back to</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the village. We were aching </span><span>with the hunger</span><span class="c0">. From every</span></p><p class="c1"><span>house</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;came the smell of flesh roasting. When I reached</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home I looked on the floor. It was covered with leather,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long strips of it and big cowhides.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, King of Virtues, where did you get it?&rdquo; said I to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father, who was eating at the table.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all the strands in the north full of it?&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every man and woman was now keeping watch for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">low neap-tide, leaving home at the chirp of the sparrow,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">searching every cave, cove, cliff, and crevice, and coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home in the evening with big bundles of leather, rain-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coats, shirts, strips of cloth, and caps in plenty. Whenever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you looked out to the Pass of the Hill-Slope, or to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">top of the road, or to the road west, you would be sure to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">see someone returning home with a bundle on his back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A week and a month passed with no school nor any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought of it, and, as the proverb says, that which is long</span></p><p class="c1"><span>absent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;grows cold. The ship&rsquo;s cargo was at an end now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and nothing to be had on the sea, but everyone was mak-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing for the strands and coves to gather in the cloth and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the leather. Tomas and I were too young and weak to go</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the strands in the north, but even so we were not be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hind with the plunder, though we were only searching</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">Blind Cove, Boat Cove and the Shingle Strand.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XIV. The Wanderer</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next Sunday evening my grandfather and I were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sitting by the fire. My father and my brother Shaun were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gone since morning to Mass, and my sisters were walking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the village as is the habit of the girls on Sunday</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when the weather is fine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My grandfather was telling me stories of old times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">While we were talking, my father and Shaun returned</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a stranger with them they had brought from Dun-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quin. My grandfather got up to welcome the stranger and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gave him a chair beside the hearth.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was a short sturdy man, well-favoured, shy-looking,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the length of my hand of moustache. He sat staring</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">straight into the middle of the fire as if his thoughts were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">elsewhere. After a while he took an old pipe, as black as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soot, from his pocket and thrust it into the ashes. He had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not a word to say but as we would question him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Eileen had the tea ready: &ldquo;Now, stranger,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father, &ldquo;come over to the table.

Maura and Eileen went out again to stroll from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cottage to cottage. I decided to stay at home in the hope</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of hearing stories from the stranger. My father lit the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lamp.

Where is the Clare man?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I swear by the book I was like a man who would be out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his senses.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;On my soul, it was no wonder for you,&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather, eagerly listening. As for myself, my heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was leaping with delight, the way it seemed I was there</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself at that moment.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, men,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I was trembling hand and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">foot. &lsquo;Twelve attempts I made to get out of the graveyard,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up to my hip in grass and shrubs. At last I succeeded, but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was as blind as ever as to where I was&mdash;a great green</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meadow all round me and not a light from God above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was walking on and on, a small, narrow path out before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me, until at last I saw in the distance many lights.

I went towards it and soon</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw it was a big, beautiful castle. If it is no better let it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be no worse, said I, but where am I going? What was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">troubling me most was the man who had been with me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the evening before and the strange black dog. What were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the delusions which had come over me and how on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">earth of the world had I parted from them?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word, it would confuse anyone,&rdquo; said my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grandfather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;No doubt </span><span>of it</span><span class="c0">,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I made towards the light, for I said to myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span>that wherever I was the people of the house </span><span>would di</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rect me. It was approached by the most beautiful path</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sinner&rsquo;s eye ever beheld, a nice stairway up to the door</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and flowers of all hues bordering it on every side. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>lights</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the castle were dazzling me. Before long I ran</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Straight into a tree and was thrown backwards. &ldquo;The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">devil, you are a queer tree,&rsquo; said I, looking up at it. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">continued on my way along the path. By now I was get-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ting a sweet smell and could hear the sound of meat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roasting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I went up the stairs.

I tried to speak with him but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all he did was to bend his head, like this.&rdquo; (The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stranger got up, put his two hands under his arm-pits</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and bent his head.)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I swear by the devil, when I saw what he was doing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T felt very queer and a chill came into my blood. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked in through the door. There was a room before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my face. At the far end I saw a fine handsome girl</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sharpening knives and talking rapidly. I put a listening</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ear on myself and it seemed to me she was Irish. On</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my left was a big table laden with riches, six men seated</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at it, everyone with a knife and fork, eating and con-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">versing together. But as soon as they saw me they stopped,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">put their hands under their arm-pits and bowed their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heads. And as sure as I am here tonight, old man,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the stranger, striking his fist on my grandfather&#39;s knee,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I recognized every one of them, all of them dead for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">years before.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A cold spasm ran up through my body.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Weil, well,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;it is a wonder the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul did not fall out of you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil it is,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;I had my courage then</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as well as I have it now, but I felt very queer when I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">recognized the six.

Looking back I saw a bicycle com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing towards me like the wind. I could not get out of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way. It was impossible. God save my soul, said I, he will</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">split me. I looked back again. He was nearer now, a big</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lamp of light on the bicycle and no slackening speed. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked up at the wall to see if I could climb it.

He pulled me out of the ranks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon he brought along another officer taller than him-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rsquo; I did not answer. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">two officers stood talking. Then a man came up behind</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my back and another before my face. But I had learnt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my lesson well from the old soldier and knew what was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to come. The man behind fired a shot over my head but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remained as firm as a post.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God, you made a great stand,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They kept me there for a couple of days trying every</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trick on me. I cannot help laughing when I think of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>other</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;dodge they tried. I was told one day to go for a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walk. I went out through a narrow passage where on</span></p><p class="c1"><span>either</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>side</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were storehouses. But, if so, I knew it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not for my good they gave me leave to go walking. What</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">happened then, ast&eacute;r, but some of the officers were inside</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the houses and now and again one of them would throw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out a penny to see if I would turn for it. I walked on and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the money ringing in my ears after me, but that is all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the heed I gave to it. To make a long story short, they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had to let me go in the end, and that is how I got out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the red army.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, may you be better a year from today,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my grandfather, looking at the clock. &ldquo;How pleasantly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you have shortened the night for us!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, there is no limit to the man who travels,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said I, making my voice heard as well as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the others.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning as soon as I lifted the cloth from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">window, the sunbeams poured in, dazzling my eyes.

Come aboard now, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the boat is due to leave.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The work I had to do was to keep up the coal in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the boiler, and that place was the devil itself for heat.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Every half-hour I had to throw off my shoes to let the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sweat out of them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, and how long would you be at the task?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Four hours at a stretch.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, it was too long,&rdquo; said I, looking again at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pipe. It was out and he seemed to have no inclination</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to give me a smoke. So I was not too well satisfied. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>tried</span><span>&nbsp;to ask him for it, but I </span><span>had</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>not the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;courage. At</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">last I thought of a plan. I took out of my pocket an old</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">clay pipe and struck it on my palm. &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said I, feel-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing in my pocket, &ldquo;I have forgotten my tobacco.

I spent a couple of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">days there, loitering. The intention I had was to escape</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to America in one of the liners from Liverpool.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One evening as I was rambling along the quay and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I in old rags the way nobody would notice me, I saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">three liners alongside ready to leave.

I kept an eye on every nook and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">corner till at last I got an opportunity to slip on board</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">unknown to the sailors.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And in what part of the ship did you hide?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, I went aforeships into a big dirty pipe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But I did not mind so long as I </span><span>would</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;get across.

Everything went well till I came to the end</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of my provisions.

I lost</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">patience.

So it was my intention to creep up at night-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fall and get into one of them for I would never be seen</span></p><p class="c1"><span>inside, since those boats </span><span>do be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;always covered in canvas.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;When night came I rose up cautiously and looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around.

I crept</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out sideways and stood up, and, if so,&rdquo; said he, striking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his palms on his knees, &ldquo;I could scarcely stand upright</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on my feet, my legs were so weak beneath me. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was no one alive on deck at the time and I was from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">step to step until I went up into one of the boats. I raised</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the canvas and crept in and sat down comfortably be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tween two thwarts. But the devil take it, Maurice,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he, striking his hand on my shoulder and making me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">jump, &ldquo;when I opened the box it was empty!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, God be with us, wasn&rsquo;t that bad luck for you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of it, and God send that such a mis-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fortune may never overtake me again.

It was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now my heart was a-flutter with fear and a shiver going</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through my body when I heard the sailors talking and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking round and thinking every minute they would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lift the cover from the boat. That day seemed a year to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me, and what wonder with ne&rsquo;er a bite nor a sup had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gone into my guts for two days before! Night came at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">last. I had some knowledge of the officers&rsquo; duties, so I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knew there do be five minutes with no one at all on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">deck. But what good was that to me when I was not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">carrying the time? So all I could do was to make a guess</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and there&rsquo;s no doubt but it was hard for me. Well, at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about two o&#39;clock in the morning I fancied the time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had come, for it is then they do take a rest. Carefully I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>lifted the cover and put out my head. I glanced </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one alive was to be seen, but lights in plenty and a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine view of the quay. I said to myself that it was the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time of the rest surely. I arose and put out a foot very</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">carefully, for it was nailed boots I had on. When I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out of the boat I did not leave an inch of the deck with-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out examining it minutely. Not a soul nor a sinner was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to be seen. But the worst of it was there was an iron</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">staircase down to the lower deck and I had to get down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that staircase however I managed it. Twelve rungs it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had, and you would need to be strong, agile and nimble</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to climb down them.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you, yourself, were not so</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at that time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You may say so,&rdquo; said he, shaking his head. &ldquo;Well,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I to myself, God guide me aright, will I make the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">attempt? My courage came to me then and I moved to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the head of the stairs. I started down from rung to rung,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But when I had passed the seventh, the devil if I didn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">slip and fall down in a heap on the deck and take a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ringing echo out of the ship!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Och, man, wasn&#39;t that a great pity, and wasn&rsquo;t it</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">strange you didn&rsquo;t think of taking off your nailed boots?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said he pitifully, &lsquo;but wisdom comes after</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">action. Well, I tried to get up, but I was too weak, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the flutter of the world was on me for fear I would be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seen.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was not long there when I heard the walk of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shoes towards me.

The words were not out of my mouth when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;officer was standing before me. He looked at me,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">caught me by the shoulder. &lsquo;What brought you here?&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he angrily. &lsquo;Musha, I am one of the sailors.&rsquo; &lsquo;And</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what brought you here?&rsquo; said he again. &lsquo;Musha, I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seized with sickness in bed and I came up on deck to take</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the air.&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He stopped for a while, looking at me keenly, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>my heart </span><span>leaping</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with the hope that he would leave me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last: &lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He brought me out into the light and, my sorrow,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;easy for him then to see what sort I was.

The Lobster Season</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I have said already, I had let school drop for some</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time on account of the wreck. I was growing up now</span></p><p class="c1"><span>without a care </span><span>or a trouble</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the world. I had no home</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lessons at night to sicken me, nor did I spend Sunday</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night waiting fearfully for Monday morning. I was free</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the oppression of the master.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the month of May 1919 my father came to me. &ldquo;T</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wonder, Maurice, would you be loath to do a lobster</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">season with us this year?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed I would not,&rdquo; I cried eagerly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed, a laugh which seemed as if he were saying</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in his heart, Upon my word, you will be loath yet, my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lad.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">How happy I was now, a grown man fishing lobsters</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with my father! I longed for the month of June, to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out on the sea. Soon we began making the pots out in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the booly, stripped to the shirt, working away at them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">while my grandfather sat on the green grass putting tops</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the twigs for us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dare say, daddo,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is many a day since you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">made your first pot.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It must </span><span>be near</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>twoscore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;years ago now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Is that afl?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in surprise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s all indeed, for we hadn&rsquo;t the knowledge be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fore then.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you get the knowledge?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; said he, throwing aside the twig he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had finished topping,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was some Englishmen who came to Beg-inish,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he looked out to Beg-inish as he spoke. &ldquo;They had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a big boat and they used to spend the week there fishing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>That is why the old </span><span>ruin</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>is to be</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>seen</span><span>&nbsp;on the </span><span>island still</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, Maurice, one day we were going out to Mass&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the King, Shaun Fada, and I&mdash;and we were rowing at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our ease past Beg-inish to the north when my oar caught</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in a rope. &lsquo;Draw it in,&rsquo; said Shaun, &lsquo;to sce what is the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meaning of it at all.&rsquo; I began drawing it up, and faith,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on every fathom of it was a cork. I thought that very</span></p><p class="c1"><span>strange</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and before long I felt a big weight on the rope.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was drawing and drawing till I had it up to the gun-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wale. What was it but a pot with a big red crayfish inside,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">though none of us knew what a crayfish was at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;My heart from the devil,&rsquo; cried Shaun Fada, &lsquo;it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the devil himself is in it.

It would gladden</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your heart to look out to sea, the sea-raven standing on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the rock with his wings outspread, the ring-plover and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea-pie foraging among the stones, the sea-gulls picking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the limpets, the limpet itself relaxing its grip and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">periwinkle the same, the crab and the rock-pool trout</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coming out of their holes in the stillness of the sea to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take a draught of the sweet-smelling air. So that it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no wonder for the sinner to feel a happiness of heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span>as he </span><span>travelled</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the road.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had the pots ready we turned our faces west</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to </span><span>Inish-na-Br&eacute;</span><span class="c0">&mdash;my father, my uncle, and myself. It was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a great change of life for me, doing a man&rsquo;s hunting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now. We laid a pot in every crack in the rocks along</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the north coast of Inish-na-Br&eacute;. It was a wild backward</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">place, great dizzy cliffs above my head in which hundreds</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and thousands of birds were nesting, the guillemot, whip-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">peen, common puffin, red puffin, black-backed gull,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">petrel, sea-raven, breeding together in the wild cliffs;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seals in couples here and there sunning themselves on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the rocks, each bird with its own cry and the seals with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their moan, a dead calm on the sea but for the little</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ripples moving in and making a </span><span>glug-glag</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;up through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the crevices of the rocks.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was sitting in the middle of the curragh, taking heed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of all around me, as happy as any mother&rsquo;s son. Now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and then I saw a puffin coming in from the sea with a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bundle of sprats across its bill, and I began to reflect</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the life of the birds, what great wisdom they have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to provide for their young. What was the difference be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tween the nature of man, the nature of the birds and of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the seals? We were fishing lobster to nourish ourselves,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the puffin providing for its chick, and the seal stretched</span></p><p class="c1"><span>out on the rock above after its </span><span>labours</span><span class="c0">. How strange is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the way of the world!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had the pots laid in the sea, we went ashore</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the island. It was a delight to be in it, the stones ready</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to burst with the heat, clumps of thrift on every inch</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the ground, and bright flowers blooming. I sat down,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the sea-birds settled </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me, many more flying through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the air with a great clamour as they came in from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea, a haze floating across each hill and hanging at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">foot of every cliff, a path of gold stretching out before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me as far as Bray Head and every ripple glistening in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sunshine.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I got up and looked </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">. My father and uncle were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nowhere to be seen. I turned my face straight north</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the White Furrow. Rabbits fled before me on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every side. I went to the top of Sailors&rsquo; Strand, hundreds</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of feet</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;high. I saw the birds nesting in the black cliff,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">others coming in towards me from the sea. It seemed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as if they were playing tricks on me. They would make</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">straight towards me, then curve out to sea, then, by the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">same curve, in again. I looked down at the shore far</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">below and saw the seals stretched out on every rocky</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ledge. I stayed a while watching and listening to the cries</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the birds, the moaning of the seals, and the murmur</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the waves. Then I turned up towards the Gaps, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">highest hill in the island, soft clumps of thrift under</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my feet, and a wide open view southward to Iveragh and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Skelligs, where the gannet nests, and so eastward to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Bay of Dingle and Kerry Head. I was sitting on a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine soft clump of thrift, sinking right back into it, think-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing and ever thinking of the creation of the world, when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard a whistle. I raised my head and looked round,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but no one was to be seen. Then I glanced far down to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the landing-place where we had moored the curragh and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw my father, cap in hand, beckoning me. They were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going out to draw the pots. I ran down the slope of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hillside, leaping from clump to clump. Halfway down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got a start, for I heard a sharp scream under my feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had leapt on the back of a rabbit which had been sit-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ting on its haunches at the mouth of its burrow. I took</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it up</span><span>, </span><span>but the life</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was crushed out of it. I ran on, very</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">proud to have caught a rabbit without dog or trap, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing Cos-f&eacute;-Chrios + could not have done in his prime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I made no stop nor </span><span>stay</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;till I reached the landing-place.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We turned west through the Narrow Sound. Not a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stir of swell on the rocks, a heron standing on the shore</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before me with his neck straight out as if watching a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fish, a ring-plover and a sea-pie by his side; and you</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Foot-under-Girdle.

But one day when we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were out as usual, I noticed a difference.

The Wedding Day</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the following evening a curragh came in from Dun-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quin with an invitation to the people of the Island to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">present at Ballyferriter next day, Shrove Tuesday, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the marriage of Shaun Fitzgerald.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fine evening. I was sitting on a rock over-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>looking the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sea. There was a light breeze from the east,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">frost on the ground, hooded crows flying across the fields</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with a caw-caw, thrushes, blackbirds, and starlings sing-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing sweetly in the meadows; and if you turned your</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eyes seaward, herring-gulls and black-backed gulls diving</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the water and a sea-raven among them pursuing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">small fish. Out before me were Mount Brandon, Mount</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Eagle, and the Macgillycuddy Reeks, clear of all </span><span>vapour</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and mist.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a lovely sight, praise on high to God who made</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heaven and earth, and I fell thinking of all the happy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">days I had spent in the view of those hills and recalled</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the words of my grandfather: Twenty years a-growing,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">twenty years in bloom, twenty years a-stooping, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">twenty years declining. I looked down over the cliff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where a seal was moaning softly. I wonder, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, are the same thoughts troubling you? Maybe you are</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">keening mournfully for your fair child which the sea-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">swell snatched from you out of your cave, or some such</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Night was falling. I walked up from the cliff&rsquo;s edge</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a little way and sat down. As I looked out again to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mount Eagle I saw a sickle of gold climbing up behind</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the hill. The moon was rising. She ascends very slowly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and sheds a golden light over the shadowy glens. I seem</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to hear the meads and valleys utter a cry of joy as if to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">welcome her and she smiling down on them with a greet-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing to Corcagueeny. I seem to see before me, full of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bright laughter, all the boys and girls who were with me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I was a child. I see them running down the lanes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and hiding themselves&mdash;the game we used to play in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moonlight~and I hear old Paddy crying in the distance</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; ...I arise and walk slowly towards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">house.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I came home, Maura and Eileen were busy</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ironing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said my grandfather, &ldquo;you will have a great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">day in Ballyferriter tomorrow, for there will be a dead</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">calm on the sea to judge by the look of the night.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I ate my supper and went off to the house of Shaun</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O&#39;Shea, where the boys and girls used to gather together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were there before me, talking of nothing but the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wedding. I sat next to Mauraid Buckley, a handsome</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blue-eyed girl with curly black hair, I felt very happy. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could not understand it. It seemed to me that night that</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Mauraid was the loveliest girl </span><span>in the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Island. I would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">never have tired talking to her though we had often been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">together before and she had never pleased me so well.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mauraid,&rdquo; said I at last, &ldquo;I am very happy entirely</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talking to you tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A blush came into her face. &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said she with her eyes on the ground.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because I love you, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She did not answer me for a while.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you, anyway, whether you are in earnest or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">only mocking me,&rdquo; said she at last.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart leapt for joy. How great is the power of the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">god of Love. He destroyed the city of Troy, the way</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thousands of men were slain for the sake of one woman,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and so it is no wonder he found it easy that night to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">subdue me who was young and foolish. Every word that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came from the mouth of Mauraid was as sweet to me as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the song of the lark. How greatly I was deceived by</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cupid!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you going to the wedding tomorrow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I am.

Did you never hear it said: A</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man without wife or children a man without heed for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anyone?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said he with a shrug, &ldquo;you haven&#39;t found one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yourself yet.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If so, I have not walked the parishes yet in quest of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her as you have done. Come home,&rdquo; said Michael.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were up at six, Maura, Eileen, Shaun, and I. It was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a beautiful morning, a streak of light across Cnoc-a-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">comma in the east and life coming into everything. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sheep which had been sitting in the furrow in the run</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the night, arose and stretched itself. The folded leaf</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was opening. The hen which had hidden her head under</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her wings was crying gob-gob-gob to be let out into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fields. Bird, beast, and man were awaking to pay homage</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the sun. A moment before not a sound was to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard, but now the birds were singing, the cow, the sheep,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and even man himself throwing up their snatches of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">song.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were washed and cleaned and ready for the road,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>delight and gladness in our hearts, every minute </span><span>scem</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing as long as an hour in our haste to go out to the wed-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ding. How gay is youth, without a trouble or a care in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the world, always full of fun and laughter! Even in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sight of two hens fighting a cause for merriment!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went down to the landing-place. We had hardly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reached the top of the cliff when the youths and maidens</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were coming down, laughing, from all directions to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quay. As I think of that morning I move back along the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">paths of thought. I see them now. I hear Red Shevaun</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bursting into laughter, the idle talk and the nonsense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">. . . Alas, we are as far from each other today as is the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">star from Spain.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We put out the curraghs and rowed, stripped to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shirt, across the Sound till we were approaching Great</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cliff in Dunquin. There must be some magic connected</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with the sea, it filled me with such delight that morning,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was low tide, without a stir in the water; red weed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and wrack-weed lying still on the sand; rocks all around</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us warming their pates in the sun; barnacles and peri-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">winkles loosening their hold on the stones and creeping</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around at their leisure; little groups of crabs coming out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of their holes, a sea-raven and a diver standing on a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reef with their wings outspread to seaward and their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">necks craned watching us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tide was too low to take the curragh up to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quay. Everyone was shouting at once what it was best</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to do. One suggested we should take off our shoes, wade</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ashore, and walk up. One agreed and twelve did not.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At last Shaun Tomas spoke out: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what</span></p><p class="c1"><span>is best</span><span class="c0">? Let us go up to Hurdle Cliff.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It is a calm, handy cove with a little shingle strand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at the head. We jumped out, moored the curraghs and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turned joyfully up into the mainland as is the wont of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Islander when he gets his liberty.

cocks crowing and answering one another, dogs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">barking and mares neighing in the meadows below, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yellow furze blooms shining in the sun and the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">light glittering on the roofs of the houses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Maurice,&rdquo;

I pressed on, pushed ahead</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by Mauraid, till at last we reached the public-house of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shamus Kane. But we were going from bad to worse, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we could not put our noses across the threshold. Nothing</span></p><p class="c1"><span>but shouting and disputing and </span><span>drink</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;flying in the air.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait here, Mauraid,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;until I get in somehow,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and if our companions are inside I will come out for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went in, pushing and pushing till at last the cap</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fell from my head. I bent down to find it, but, if so, I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could not get up again. I was groping around till at last</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got it, but my trouble now was to stretch myself up,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the weight from above was too heavy on me. A big</span></p><p class="c1"><span>man</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was standing beside me. I asked him to let me get</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up. But all he did was to go on shouting. As he gave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me no heed I got angry, so that when I found on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">floor a pin sharply pointed, I thrust it into his thigh. He</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lifted his leg from the ground so suddenly that he kicked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the man in front of him, who had a pint of porter in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his hand, and sent both the man and the porter sprawling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on the floor. It is then was the rushing, wrestling, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gnashing of teeth, for when the other fellow got up he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">didn&rsquo;t saw a word but struck on the bridge of the nose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the man who had kicked him. I struggled to my feet at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">last and made my way into the kitchen. But none of my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">own people were to be found there. When I came out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again, what a sight was before me! Blood flying to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rafters and some foolish fellow encouraging the man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from whom it was flowing. &ldquo;Your soul to the devil, don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">let down City-cow-titty! Remember your ancestors! Strike</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the bostoon!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I reached the door somehow, but Mauraid was not to</span></p><p class="c1"><span>be seen, God be with me </span><span>for ever</span><span class="c0">, I am alone in the end,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I. I went down the road and before long I found her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing shyly under the wall of the house of Liam de</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Londra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The poor woman was delighted to see me. &ldquo;Oh, Lord,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said she, &ldquo;I thought you would never come out again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What delayed you at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It was like this, Mauraid,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, it is well I know that fighting.

I knew now that she loved me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went in, and it is there was the ree-raa, the merry-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making and good fellowship, dancing, singing, and di-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">version, all the others from the Island before us, merry</span></p><p class="c1"><span>with drink</span><span class="c0">. Mauraid and I danced together that day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in great happiness.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two of us were sitting now, a good coat of sweat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on us, a couple of sets being danced on the floor. A short,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sharp-eyed, hardy block of a lad came in through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">doorway. He stopped and looked round. Everyone was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watching him till the dances were over. Then he ran</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">across to the musician, put a whisper in his ear, and took</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a goat&rsquo;s-leap back into the middle of the floor. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">musician struck up a horn-pipe and the dancer beat it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out faultlessly. It is wonderful feet he had, not a note</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the music did he miss, as straight as a candle, not a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stir of his body except down from his knees. The whole</span></p><p class="c1"><span>company</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sat watching him, without a word. You could</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hear them drawing their breath. He gave the last kick,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked around, and cried out:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I am the broom from the top of </span><span>Maurhan</span><span class="c0">,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And where is the man who will beat out a step with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No one answered. When he saw no one was rising</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to accept his invitation to beat out a step with him, he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">disappeared through the doorway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day was almost spent now, the sun taking to his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bed, the cow coming back to her byre, even the boy and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">girl tired after all the revelry, and the merrymaking grow-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;cold. My friends and I came together to settle about</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going home.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We set out along the road to the west, talking gaily</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and contentedly of the affairs of the day, Mauraid and I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">keeping company ali the way back to Hurdle Cliff in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dunquin where we had moored the curraghs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Blasket was stretched out before us in the west</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">under a veil of mist, sheep-shearings in the sky, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thousands of points of light glittering on the sea beneath</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the moon.

It made</span></p><p class="c1"><span>me mournful</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maura came out to me. &ldquo;Oh, Mirrisheen,&rdquo; she cried,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">throwing herself into my arms and bursting into tears,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;what shall I do without you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be easy. Don&rsquo;t you see everyone is going now, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>soon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you will see me beyond like the rest of them. Hush</span></p><p class="c1"><span>now</span><span class="c0">, let us go in and dance.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She let go of me and sat down on the bank.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Lift up your heart,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;again. &ldquo;Come in with me</span></p><p class="c1"><span>now and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the two of us will dance a set.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we went in: &ldquo;Musha, my love for ever, Maura,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cried Peg Oweneen, embracing her and bursting into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tears, &lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;my life will not be long after you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Strike up a tune, Shaun,&rdquo; said I to Shaun Pats, who</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had the melodium. He began to play. Four of us arose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I called my sister for the dance.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day was brightening in the east. We washed our-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">selves and made ready for the road to Dingle to give</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Maura a last farewell. The sun was rising in </span><span>splendour</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the cocks crowing all over the village. When nine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">o&#39;clock came all the old men and old women were com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ing down towards the house. All was </span><span>confusion</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We moved down to the quay, Maura and Kate Peg</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in front of us and the whole village following.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The old women were crying aloud. &ldquo;Musha, love of</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my heart, Maura, isn&rsquo;t it a pity for ever for you to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going from us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, musha, Maura, how shall I live after you when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the long winter&rsquo;s night will be here and you not coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the door nor your laughter to be heard!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got free of them at last. We were out in Mid-Bay,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looking back at the people of the village waving their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hands and their shawls,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We spent the night in Dingle. Next morning we went</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down to the station and gave them farewell and our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blessing with sorrow and tears.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The train whistled. In a moment they were out of</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">sight.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XIX. The Stranger</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a fine sunny day in the year 1923. I was looking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after a sheep on the hillside above, the sun yellowing in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the west and a lark singing above. I raised my head and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">listened. Indeed, little bird, small as you are you have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me beguiled, said I to myself. Just then the earth shook</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beneath me. I looked up and saw five or six lambs gam-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>bolling</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;together. I heard a clatter. I heard it again, like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shingle being thrown into the sea. I looked down over</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the edge of the cliff and saw a shoal of mackerel breaking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">water with a great noise below.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A spring came into my blood and I leapt up. What ails</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me at all? The darkness is falling and I haven&#39;t found my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">black sheep yet. I walked west along the ditch, whistling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">softly to myself. I had gone about twenty yards when I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought I saw a man approaching me, a man whose like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was not in the Blasket. I stopped, looking intently. By</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God, said I to myself, you are there sure enough, and if it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is from the other world you have come you seem to me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not to be poor. Now is the time for me to stand my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ground, for maybe I will get riches out of this; that is,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if you have as much power as the leprechauns in olden</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">times. I thought I saw a smile on his face. Faith, there is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">no bad look on you, anyway.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was now only forty yards away, a man neither too</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tall nor too short, with knee-breeches and a shoulder-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cloak, his head bare and a shock of dark brown hair</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gathered straight back on it. I was growing afraid. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was not his like in the Island. Where had he come from</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he approaching me now from the top of the hill in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the darkening of the day? I leant my back against the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bank of the ditch. I drew out my pipe and lit it. Then I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turned my gaze out to the south-east, thinking no doubt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he would pass me by on his way, so that I could take his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">measure and say I had seen a leprechaun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I heard a voice behind me. &ldquo;God save you,&rdquo; it said.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I looked </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">. He was smiling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God and Mary save you, noble person,&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He sat down on a stone beside me and drew out a box</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of cigarettes. &ldquo;Will you have one?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will not, thank you,&rdquo; said I in Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was taking his measure well as we spoke and he look-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing out to Iveragh. We both remained silent for a long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time. Then he tried to say something in Irish, but failed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>So he turned </span><span>again</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to the English</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you call that place over there?&rdquo; said he ina</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very hard accent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;They call it Valencia Island,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And how would you say that in Irish?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told him. He took from his pocket a little book and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a pencil and wrote down quickly what I had said. Faith,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my lad, said I to myself, this is not the first time you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wrote Irish anyway. When he had finished I spoke to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you from, may I ask?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Repeat that, please.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you frome&rdquo; I repeated very slowly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He bent his head for a moment, muttering the words</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">under his teeth. Then he answered in English. &ldquo;I am</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from London, and I came to the Blasket today,&rdquo; said he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with a laugh. (The laugh of an Englishman, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, isn&rsquo;t it often I was told to beware of it!)</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He asked my name. I told him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Mine is George Thomson,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I&#39;m thinking you have Ivish too,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; said he with another laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was growing dark and we moved east towards the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">village. He was questioning me about this word and that</span></p><p class="c1"><span>word</span><span>&nbsp;in Irish, and I </span><span>giving</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;him their meaning. When we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came to the top of the boreen: &ldquo;Where are you staying?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stopped for a moment to think: &ldquo;I am in the house</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Michael Guheen. Is that right?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and as I said before, you will soon im-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">prove in the language.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There is no doubt but youth has great ability. George</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I spent the next six weeks walking together on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">strand, hill, and mountain, and after spending that time</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in my</span><span>&nbsp;company he </span><span>had</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>fluent Irish</span><span class="c0">. If everyone in Ire-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">land were as eager as he for the language, the people of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old Ireland would be Gaels again without much delay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But, alas, it is not so; for if one is eager there are twelve</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who are not, though there is a kind of awakening in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">language now, great thanks to God.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One fine morning my father and I were at breakfast.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>A sunbeam was pouring through the window, the </span><span>mur</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>mur</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of bees all around, the cat on the window-ledge</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making dabs with her paw at a bee which was walking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up the window-pane. I noticed a spider&#39;s web between the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side of the window and the wall and himself sound asleep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the middle of it. It happened that the bee touched the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">web. When the spider felt it he awoke from his sleep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and made a dart for the bee. The cat cocked her ears</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watching the two of them, as if greatly amused. Then she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pounced and killed both the bee and the spider. And that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the end of the fun.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; said my father, &ldquo;it would be a good day to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bring home those two sheep that are west on Red Ridge.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As we walked up the Causeway we met George coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where are you going today?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lam going into the hill with my father to bring home</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">two sheep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I will come with you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, you won&#39;t, for you would fall from the cliffs.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&quot;I will not,&rdquo; said he, turning on his heel and </span><span>accom</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">panying us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The day was fine and sultry and we had stripped off</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our coats. We walked into the hill, as happy as children,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talking and conversing, giving words of Irish to George</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till we reached Red Ridge. We sat down to rest, looking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">south to the Skelligs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t this place very different from the city of Lon-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">don?&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is indeed,&rdquo; said George, passing his fingers through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his hair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is a pity I am not in the city of London now,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, &ldquo;for it is a fine view I would have.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said George, turning to me with a frown</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of surprise. &ldquo;Indeed you would not, but the heat killing</span></p><p class="c1"><span>you and your </span><span>health failing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for want of air. And as for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the view, you would be looking at the same thing always</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;people walking the streets with nothing in them but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">only the breath, and believe me if one of them could see</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this view out before me now, he would give his riches</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said my father, getting up. &ldquo;Faith,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George, maybe you are getting hungry to be fasting so</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, words do not fatten the friars,&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are as well worded now as any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old man in the village. The two of you had better wait</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here now until I go north to Halberd Hollow after the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old ewe.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went north through the Sc&eacute;rnach and down through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the fern, up to my waist in heather and wild flowers, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dizzy ravine above and beneath me and the sea far below</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dashing against the rocks. Many sheep were around me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here and there, but my own old ewe was not among them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was easy to recognize for she had not been shorn,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was a good climber, so I made my way to the cliffs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was nothing beneath my feet but the blue sea,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the slightest stumble would have sent me headlong</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as sauce for the crabs below. I stopped again to watch</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the flocks of sea-birds nesting in the cliff, some flying</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">around and others on the surface of the waves. By God,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George, said I in my own mind, if you were here now and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw this view, you would never go back to England again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly I felt the earth shaking beneath my feet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking up, I saw the sky blackened by a big black mass</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of turf. God save my soul, I cried, it will strike me surely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt aside. Each time it struck the cliff it rebounded</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the air like a football. It rushed past me with a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">terrible whirl. I watched it hurtling down the cliff till</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at last it struck the water. A spurt of foam leapt into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">air and fell down again with a splash which made the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whole cliff ring. In a moment the birds were in a tumult,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">darting with wild cries out to sea and chattering excitedly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like any nation of men fleeing for their lives from an</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">earthquake.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I moved west across Fern Bottom, glancing from side</span></p><p class="c1"><span>to side</span><span class="c0">, till I reached Bun-a-Doiteain. There I saw my old</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shred of a ewe down on the lowest ledge. I went down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards her, and I climbed down to places that day which</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I would not have the courage even to look </span><span>at now</span><span class="c0">. When</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I was twenty yards from </span><span>her I stopped</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and shouted. She</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lifted her head slowly, but that was all the heed she gave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me. I shouted again and again, but it was no use. I took</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a stone and threw it at her. It whistled down through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">air and struck her in the middle of the back. Away she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ran up the cliff. I followed breathlessly after her. She was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wild with fright, and what wonder!l&mdash;a sheep which had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not been caught for three years and had spent all that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time among the ravines, only fit for the birds of the sea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I kept her in sight till at last she tripped up and came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tumbling head over heels like a snowball. Oh, I cried,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she will go over! She landed in a furrow of fern. Ah, it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ever said, I cried joyfully, that an inch is as good as all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Treland.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went up to her. Her four feet were in the air kicking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wildly. Faith, you look very uncomfortable, said I, catch-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing her and lifting her up. She gave a leap but I kept my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grip, though it was a dangerous one to try to keep on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side of the cliff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was between two minds now. Would I keep her or let</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her go? If I keep her, I said to myself at last, both she and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I will be thrown into the sea. So I let her follow her nose</span></p><p class="c1"><span>through the cliff, I </span><span>running</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;behind her. She made for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fearee. But I was as quick as herself to reach the top.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she made off to the east, I following, coated with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sweat and blinded with fern. I shouted hard but it was of</span></p><p class="c1"><span>no avail</span><span class="c0">. She was drifting down again, as is the way of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sheep when they are weak, and this one was weak indeed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on account of her age, for you could hear the crack of her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old bones as she ran. Again I started off after her. Birds,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sheep and rabbits fled in terror to see the madman shout-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing through the fern. At last I ran her down. She stopped.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped too. We looked at each other. She fixed her eyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on me like a beaten man as if to say, Won&#39;t you let me go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I threw a stone. &ldquo;Up with you,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off she went again, I throwing stones on each side of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her. Now and then she stopped and looked back at me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pitifully with her tongue hanging out of her mouth. She</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was tiring. She moved slowly on through the ravine till</span></p><p class="c1"><span>she</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;reached the top. By now she was so exhausted she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could hardly put one leg before another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Musha, how my heart opened when I got a draught</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the fine sweet air which was flowing across the summit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the Skelligs! I took the fill of my belly of it and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sat down on a clump of grass, tired out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked round for my father and George, but I could</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not see them. I put a finger in my mouth and whistled.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then I saw George getting up out of the fern, smiling as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">usual. He came up to me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, stretching himself, &ldquo;the sun has me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">killed,&rdquo; and he threw himself into the fern beside me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is very sultry,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but what about the man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who has been running ever since, up and down the cliff</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after his sheep?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dare say you are accustomed to it,&rdquo; said he, taking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out his pipe and tobacco.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did the same and we sat there smoking and discussing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the world together, I with an odd glance at the old ewe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for fear she would make for the cliff again. But she stood</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">very quietly, though she was still too frightened to take</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grass,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I turned my head I saw my father down at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yellow Banks after the other sheep. I leapt up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said I to George; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stir out of that, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>whatever</span><span>&nbsp;you </span><span>do don&rsquo;t</span><span>&nbsp;let that old </span><span>ewe north</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;again.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He got up in surprise. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see my father? He&rsquo;s finding that sheep too</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">much for him and I am going to help him. We&#39;ll be up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here in a moment. But, devil, don&rsquo;t let that old ewe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">north.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went down the hill towards the Palm. I ran the sheep</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down and the two of us drove it east as far as the White</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stones. When we had taken a rest: &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said I,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;could you keep her here till I go and bring the other</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the north?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said my father.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went back to the place where I had left George and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the old ewe. When I came in sight of the Sc&eacute;rnach, what</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did I see but George, coat in hand, running as fast as he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could after about two hundred sheep across Red Ridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped and looked at him. Wasn&rsquo;t it a great and won-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>derful</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;work he had in hand to bring those two hundred</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">together! I scratched my head in amazement. Oh, Lord,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I, the ewe I am after bringing from the north is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">among those as sure as I live, and that is why he is pur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">suing them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked up to the place where I had left the ewe, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there she was still! I was lost in wonder. What in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>world</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;possessed him to run after those? I whistled and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">whistled again, but he gave no heed. I kept on whistling,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but he was running after them still with no thought of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stopping. As sure as I live and there&rsquo;s a cross on the ass,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I, it is over the cliff you will go, I shouted in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">height of my head. Just then I saw him throwing his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coat after them. Then he went head over heels into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heather.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart leapt. &ldquo;You must be hurt,&rdquo; said I, running</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards him. When I was within twenty yards of him</span></p><p class="c1"><span>he got</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;up and looked around. When he saw me he gave a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine hearty laugh.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there any injury on you?&rdquo; said I, my heart beating.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is not, faith,&rdquo; said he, looking away towards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the sheep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my soul, George, you are the man who slew a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hundred.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Maurice, I had to let them go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, what came over you or what order did</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you get to keep a watch on those shorn sheep?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Didn&#39;t you tell me yourself?&rdquo; he asked in wonder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I did not. I told you to watch the ewe I brought from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the north.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, I see, and where is that ewe now?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There in the same place still.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s all right, so, but I thought those sheep were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all yours and that you wanted to bring them in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dare say but for the fall you got you would be run-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ning after them still, and observe that it is not the smooth</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pavements of England you have here, my boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Maurice,&rdquo; said he with a laugh, &ldquo;observe yourself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">how I compelled the earth here to kiss me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, it was the earth compelled you to kiss it, but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">come now till we drive the wild ewe east, for my father</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is waiting for us at the Scythe Rocks with the other one.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We got the two sheep together, Then we sat on the top</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of a rock looking out over the Bay of Dingle at the </span><span>traw</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>lers</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fishing and the sea-birds flying around in search of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fish,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I arose and looked up at the sheep. &ldquo;I dare say it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time for us to be making our way to the east before night</span></p><p class="c1"><span>comes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We set out, up to our knees in fern and rushes, I above,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my father below, George between us, and the dog on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">top above me. When either of the sheep would take a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">step astray Rose would be at her hind legs and put her</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">straight again. We shortened our road with talk, walking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on at our ease till at last we reached Shingle Strand where</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;sheep </span><span>do be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rounded up. Rose was out before us,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">barking furiously, till she had driven the two into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cave of Shevaun de Londra.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I told George to stand at the mouth and, if either of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>sheep</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tried to escape, to seize it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he, stretching out his arms to each</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side of the cave.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I made a dash for the sheep. I caught one and threw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it, but the other got away. I looked round and saw it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">making for the sea with George clinging to its tail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your soul to the devil,&rdquo; I shouted, &ldquo;let her go or she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will drown you!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He let go of her at last. Rose swam out and rounded</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her in. When I returned after getting her into the cave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again, George was sitting under a rock. He had taken</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">off his shoes and was wringing the water from his stock-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ings.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had the sheep shorn: &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span>my father</span><span>, &ldquo;</span><span>you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;must be hungry now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I was never so hungry in my life.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&#39;t it hard work we have here after the sheep?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No doubt of it, and it is a great wonder no one falls</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">from the cliffs after them.&rdquo;</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span>XX. My Last Journey to the </span><span>Inish</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A great change was coming on the Island. Since the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fishing was gone under foot all the young people were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">departing across to America, five or six of them together</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every year. Maura was not gone a couple of years when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;passage money was sent across to Shaun. A year after</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that Eileen went. Tom4s Owen Vaun was gone already</span></p><p class="c1"><span>for some time and he </span><span>writing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me from over there. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">brother Michael was working for a tailor in Dingle and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there was nobody left now in the house but my grand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">father, my father, and myself. George used to be visiting</span></p><p class="c1"><span>us every summer and the two of </span><span>us always</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I remember well a fine airy morning in the year 1926</span></p><p class="c1"><span>when I went out </span><span>on to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the ditch. White streaks of foam</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were passing up through the Sound to the north and they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nicely gathered together on the surface of the sea. Then</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they would turn in on each other till not a trace of them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was to be seen. There was a wonderful stillness. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mountains were clear before me, nodding their heads</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">above in the sky. Isn&rsquo;t it they that are proud to have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">power to be higher than the rest, thought I. But if so,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that height is nothing to boast of in the dark days of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">winter when they have to stand up boldly before the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">storms of the sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked around at the little wisps of smoke arising</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the houses and the air without strength to scatter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them, but the blue sky, of a hue that could not be painted,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sucking them upwards. I looked at the reflection of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rocks which was clearly visible in the sea, and when a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea-raven would dip himself he would send little nipples</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spreading out in a circle ever and ever till they were lost</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from sight.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon a steamship rounded the Gob from the south,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">steering close to the shore. She let out a shriek which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sent the village dogs wild with barking and aroused the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea which till then had been calm and still. She rent it on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every side, sending big ripples inshore till they made a</span></p><p class="c1"><span>glug-glag</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;up through the crevices of the rocks. Then the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea calmed again the way you would think it had never</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stirred.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Meanwhile my father and my uncle were making them-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">selves ready for the Inish. I put my head in across the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">threshold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you know, dad,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what I have planned to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do but for myself and George to go with you to Inish-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">vick-ilaun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is not good for you to be in,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if George</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will go.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well.

It would delight you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to see the boys and girls at that time, joy and mirth in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every step they took, and even the old women who had</span></p><p class="c1"><span>any </span><span>vigour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in them gathered in, in pursuit of the music.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About ten o&#39;clock George and I walked out a short</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">distance of the road talking together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well now, Maurice, I shall be leaving tomorrow and,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>if so</span><span class="c0">, I shall be expecting you every day from this out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Don&rsquo;t forget when you reach Tralee to send me a tele-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gram and I will be before you at the station in Dublin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I with a heavy heart and the re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>luctance</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the world, thinking of the long road which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lay before me. While George was describing the journey</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to Dublin, my own thoughts were of the fine days I had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spent hunting on the top of the hill and fishing on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sea. I seemed to see a rabbit out before me and Rose after</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it. Ah, how would I ever leave the Blasket?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>George touched me with his elbow. &ldquo;Wake up,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, there is great mourning on me, George, to leave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this place.

It was in full swing now,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">music going into the air and we spent the rest of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night in gaiety.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the morrow it was sharp and cold from the north.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went out and looked around. The day had a threaten-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing look, swell on the stones, showers falling on the edge</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the sky, and the Bank of the Black Rock breaking and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tearing from the north. Faith, said I to myself, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Paorach</span><span>&nbsp;will </span><span>have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;another day.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The word was but out of my mouth when I saw com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing down the Causeway towards me George and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">King and others after them. My soul from the devil, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, he is going out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I noticed </span><span>now a thing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I had never seen before. I did</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not see the smile on George&rsquo;s mouth. It was enough.

Then I wrote to him to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">let him know I had made up my mind to take on myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a different way of life. But, if so, my reluctance was grow-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing, for it was a great change for a young man who had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">been cut off from the great world with no knowledge of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">its affairs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One day when I was in beside the fire and nothing to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trouble me in the rainy world but the long unknown</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">journey which lay in front of me: &ldquo;Well, father,&rdquo; said I,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and he on the other side of the fire reading a letter which</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had come that day from America, &ldquo;what is your opinion</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the great, long journey that is now before me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What journey is that?&rdquo; said he quickly, raising his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head and looking at me over his glasses.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is not long now until you will see the Guards&rsquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">uniform on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked into the fire, thinking.

It was a Tuesday</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&mdash;the 15th of March 1927. I got myself ready early, for it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the day for the King to go out to bring in the post,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so I was in the yard watching out for him for fear he</span></p><p class="c1"><span>would go unknown to me.

I </span><span>knew well what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking back I saw Rose out on the bank howling as she</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw me departing from her. I crushed down the distress</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that was putting a cloud upon my heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We reached Dunquin at last. I walked slowly and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heavily up the path. I stopped. I stretched myself and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked back at the Island. Little I thought once of for-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>saking</span><span>&nbsp;it, but, my sorrow, that day </span><span>was come</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at last. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked around. There was nothing to be heard, only the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sound of the waves below. I was thinking and pondering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and no one to heed me but the God of Glory in Whom</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I trusted to guide me on the right road to the capital</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">city. I looked south at the Slea Head road and then north</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at the Ceann Sraha road, then again at the Clasach road;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I thought of a story I had read a while before of a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">widow&#39;s son who turned his breast to the great world and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the cross-roads confounding him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I heard a voice behind me: &lsquo;&lsquo;Are you </span><span>there still</span><span class="c0">?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back and saw the King. &ldquo;Faith, I am,&rdquo; said I,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shaking myself. &ldquo;There is no great hurry on me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I suppose you will be going to Dingle tonight?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I will. Is the road to the north the shortest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Without doubt it is.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We said good-bye and parted. I set out on my road,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the King on his way up towards Bally-na-Raha.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was alone now, groping my way to the north and a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wet mist over the road. When I came to the top of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carhoo I stopped again and sat down to take a rest. I lit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I LEAVE HOME 247</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my pipe seeing I had no other comfort. I looked again at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Island. It was the last sight I would get of it back from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maum-na-Carhoona. The first spot that struck my eyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was the summit of the Cr&eacute;, the highest hill in it, and this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">verse came into my head:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thou art there, beautiful Cr&eacute;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With thine ancient heather summit,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he who once raced on thee</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking back on thee in sorrow.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, said I, getting up, however long the journey is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before me, I have no cause to let the night catch me here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stepped out, ever and ever, until I came down into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ballyferriter, It was necessary for me to get a certificate</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the priest there and I made my way to his house. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span>girl</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;came to the door. &ldquo;Is the priest inside, if you please?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I. She did not answer but looked wonderingly at me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">between the eyes. &ldquo;Have you Irish?&rdquo; said I. Again no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reply from her, so I spoke to her in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh, he is. Come in </span><span>here a while</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went into a little room with many books and papers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in it. Well, thought I, isn&rsquo;t it a strange thing to meet</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">already a girl without Irish!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was looking round at the pictures on the walls but,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>if so</span><span>, no one was coming and the day </span><span>passing</span><span class="c0">. It is fine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for me, said I to myself, and the long journey I have be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>fore</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me into Dingle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment I heard striding footsteps coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards the room. The parish priest came in. I bowed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to him and he greeted me courteously. He asked me my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>name and my business. When he had given me the </span><span>certi</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ficate</span><span class="c0">, I gave him a farewell and a blessing and went on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was going on and going on when a thought came into</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my mind&mdash;the road before me seemed to go very far up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the hill. I took out my pipe and lit it. There was not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a trace of the Island to be seen now. God help me, said I,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>where</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;am I? Will there be an end to this road tonight?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I got up and looked </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me. There was a by-road</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turning east and a by-road turning west. Soon I saw an</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old man in tatters coming down towards me across the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hill, an old yellow pipe between his teeth, a couple of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cows before him. He was making towards me and calling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sho amach! sho amach! to the cows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he came down to the road I greeted him. He re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turned my greeting in fine Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Listen here, good man, is this the right road for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dingle?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It appears you are a stranger in this place?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am, good sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, have no fear.

The evening was now well</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spent, the cow lowing as is her wont when she makes her</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way to the byre, the bird, the sheep, and the horse re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turning contentedly each to its own dwelling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon I saw ahead of me big high houses packed to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>gether</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and many trees growing in their midst. It is likely</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">this is Dingle, I thought, if I live alive. My heart was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lifted with joy. Eagerly I made my way forward. I saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">coming towards me a swell of a gentleman with a chain</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">across his belly, a hard hat on his head, and an umbrella</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in his hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I greeted him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that Dingle to the east?&rdquo; said I, pointing towards it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stopped and looked at me, looked to the east, then</span></p><p class="c1"><span>looked at me again. </span><span>&ldquo;Have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you any English?&rsquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have,&rdquo; said I in English, &ldquo;but I want to know am I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">far from Dingle still?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yes, yes,&rdquo; said he, taking out a little handkerchief</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and wiping his brow, for I think he was sweating with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the walk, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s it over there among the trees.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Thank you very much,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">, going east.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back at him and, by God, he put me in mind</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of my grandfather the day he wore the tail coat, for it was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a coat of almost the same make the gentleman was wear-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that I made neither stop nor stay till I reached</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the house of Martin Kane in the town, myself and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">star together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I strolled into the kitchen and my heart full of delight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to have accomplished the journey of the day. Martin rose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the chair.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;or who are you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at all?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was surprised when I saw he did not know me though</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">indeed it was long since I had been in Dingle.

From Dingle East</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I pip not sleep much that night, ever pondering over the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">difficult journey which lay before me. I was soon in a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nightmare. Railway tracks are running across one an-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>other, I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>see the people</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like ants and myself among them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In comes the train and my heart is seized with panic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Soon it begins to move. I leap in. I slip. A man cried out,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, he is dead!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I awoke with great comfort and contentment of heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to find myself stretched in the warm bed. Three nights</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I </span><span>lived in that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;night.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About six in the morning there was a knock at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">door. &ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; said Martin, &ldquo;or you will be late.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was not long making myself ready. When I had eaten</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my breakfast, I said farewell to Martin and his wife and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">set out for the train.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">T looked down the street and up, people in plenty pass-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing me in every direction and everyone seeming to have</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his eye on me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back and noticed an old man hurrying breath-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>lessly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;behind me. Faith, said I to myself, maybe you too</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">are making for the train.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I waited for him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;God save you, sir,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;God and Mary save you,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Will you tell me, please, where is the railway station</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Follow me, my good lad.

You</span></p><p class="c1"><span>would</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;need to keep your eyes open.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were soon at the station.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is as well for you now to go into the office and get</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">your ticket,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;the train will soon be leaving.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went in. There were many before me. I waited. By</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God, said I to myself, to judge by the progress I am mak-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing, the train will go without me. I ran out on to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">platform and met a man with a horn-peaked cap on his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head. I saw that he had something to do with the train.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is it long till the train will be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He took out a watch. &ldquo;In ten minutes more,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt back into the office. The others were now ready</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and I got my ticket and came out again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>I stopped, looking all </span><span>round</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me. Oh, Lord, where did</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;people come from? A man catching a bag, a woman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">running, another woman after her, chatter and con-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fusion everywhere. They seize hold of a handle on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">outside of the train to open a door, but the door does</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not come, They run to another door, men and women</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">running together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, said I in my own mind, it is not the windy day</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is the day for scallops. If I don&rsquo;t make a better show than</span></p><p class="c1"><span>this I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;will find myself on a stranded rock. I caught up my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bag and away with me. I had only gone a few steps when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an echo came back from the whole town of Dingle with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the whistle the train threw out, and as for myself I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lifted clean from the ground. I looked round to see if</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anyone had noticed the start it took out of me, but no-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">body had. Everyone was inside the train but myself.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Off I ran, but I could not get an opening anywhere.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I was fumbling with it, I heard a voice at my back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked over my shoulder. It was the old man again. He</span></p><p class="c1"><span>opened </span><span>a door</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Go in there, and remember you have only two changes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to make, one in Tralee and one in Mallow. Good-bye</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now.&rdquo; And he shut the door behind me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sat down on the seat and soon the train began to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">move. There was no one in the compartment but myself,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was gazing out through the window&mdash;fine green fields</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and trees everywhere, houses in every glen and ravine,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the Blasket</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Island and the wild sea far out of sight. They</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were gone now and I a lonely wanderer, and as the old</span></p><p class="c1"><span>saying</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;goes, &ldquo;Bare is the companionless shoulder.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while a jolt was taken out of me and the train</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stopped. I looked out through the window and saw many</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people leaving the train. We are in Tralee, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, taking up my bag and stepping out. I ran straight</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into a horn-capped lad pushing a truck with a box on it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I beg your pardon, but is this Tralee?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stopped and looked at me. &ldquo;Arra, man, you are only</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in </span><span>Annascaul yet</span><span class="c0">. About twelve o&rsquo;clock you will be there.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A thousand thanks to you,&rdquo; said I, and in I went</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sat down, What good luck I had to come across that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man! I began looking out of the window again, but before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long I had a twist in my neck so I stretched myself at full</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">length on the seat, feeling thankful to the man of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">horn cap. How vexed and tormented I would have been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if the train had gone on without me! Would I have tried</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to walk back to Dingle? Alas, I would not have walked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it tonight. It was so I was turning over the thoughts in</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my mind and I stretched contentedly on the flat of my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The train stopped again. Again I looked out. And</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again many were leaving. As they leapt out they would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stop to look back at the train, and, faith, it seemed that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every one of them was putting his eyes through me and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saying to each other, &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t that fellow coming out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I slunk back and caught up my bag. It is likely, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I, the train will go no farther, and that worthless lout I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>met</span><span>&nbsp;on the station just </span><span>now was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mocking me. I got out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and looked round. Musha, if this is Tralee, said I, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">devil if it is much of a place to look at. I saw another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man like the one I met before. I went up to him. &ldquo;When</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shall we be in Tralee?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In another hour,&rdquo; said he, leaving me in haste.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I got back into the carriage more than ever pleased to</span></p><p class="c1"><span>find</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I was going right. Drawing out my pipe, I took a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">good smoke from it. It did me good, and why wouldn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it with the long journey I was making which had been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tormenting my mind for a week with the mere thought</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, when the time came </span><span>I was landed</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at Tralee. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span>train</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;stopped. I got out and again I spoke to one of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>horn-peaked caps. &ldquo;I suppose this will be Tralee,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">. At the same time I felt he was a nice</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man to talk to, so that I took a liking to him. We fell into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">conversation and I picked from him the time the train</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was to leave for Dublin. He said good-bye and went his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had four hours to spend in the city, but, if so, though</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had been told that the train would not start till four</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">o&#39;clock, I had no intention of leaving the station, for I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had no trust in the train but that it might go at any</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put my bag against the wall and kept my eye on it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">always. I was walking up and down at my ease. As I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked around I saw first one woman, then another, put-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ting their bags in through a window. They were given</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">some kind of red ticket and then departed. I saw two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">men doing the same. Faith, said I, it looks as if that is a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">place to keep the parcels. I caught my bag and went up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the window. Inside was a man working busily at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bags. He asked me my name and wrote it down quickly</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in a book. He put some figures on the bag and handed out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to me a little red ticket. I was well pleased with myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now, and why wouldn&rsquo;t I, and every knowledge coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to me?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wandered out again on the platform and whatever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way I looked what would I see but &ldquo;Telegraph Office&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">written in big letters over a door. My heart grew as big</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as a cow to see it and I went in to send a telegram to my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">friend George in Dublin. A girl was sitting on a chair</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before me reading a book. I greeted her. She lifted up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her head and looked at me sourly, with a sallow face on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">her and an ill-tempered expression. When I told her my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">business she got up and handed me a paper, then, sitting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down, she began to read again. Very well, my girl, said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I in my own mind, and I began to write at my leisure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I had finished my task I handed in the paper, but,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if so, even yet she did not speak a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There is no fear, my girl, but you are a stiff one,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I </span><span>in Irish</span><span class="c0">, knowing she would not understand me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good-day to you, sir,&rdquo; said she in English,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Would you believe it, I felt great esteem for myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I got that answer from her. It seems, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, I must have the look of a gentleman and she to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">calling me &ldquo;sir.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart was now rising continually the way I was get-</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ting knowledge of everything. Only one thing was trou-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bling mc&mdash;my poor empty belly. I was considering now</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would I make an attempt into the city, for the hunger</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was oppressing me and as the proverb says, &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hard for the hag she must run.&rdquo; Well, now was the time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to try it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By God, I will try.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked out of the station. But, musha, I was not far</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when my courage was failing. Putting up my hand I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">scratched my head. There was a cross-road to the east</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and a cross-road to the west, another above and another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">below. Wherever I looked there was a cross-road. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul from the devil, said I, if I go any farther I will be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like a blind man wandering through the city. I will never</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">find the right road back again. But, God save my soul, I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will be perished as it is, if I go on fasting like this, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the soul will fall out of me on the road. And then again</span></p><p class="c1"><span>if I</span><span>&nbsp;go up into the </span><span>city how</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;shall I come back?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, I walked ahead, but, if so, the farther I went the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">more the cross-roads were confounding me. I stopped.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The devil another step will I go, said I. Whatever I will</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">do without food, I have no need to send myself astray in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned on my heel and went back to the station. I sat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down on a big, long bench stretched up against the wall.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two little lads were running past me, up and down,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">playing ball. They sent me back on the paths of thought</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the time when I was doing the like on the top of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sandhills, myself and &lsquo;Tom&aacute;s Owen Vaun. After a while</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another thought struck me. I called them up to me. They</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stopped playing, looked at each other, and giggled.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Would you mind </span><span>to go</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;up into the city for me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We would not,&rdquo; said they, looking down at their feet</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bashfully.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good boys!&rdquo; And putting my hand in my pocket I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gave them some money. &ldquo;Here now, keep that for your-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">selves, and let you buy me a pound of bread and butter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with this.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They ran away without another word, and in ten min-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">utes they were back again with my food for the journey</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">done up nicely and little packets for themselves. When I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had thanked them they ran off into a quiet corner and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>soon</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I could see them chewing busily.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I had eaten I arose contentedly and began walk-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing up and down the platform again. There was only</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">another hour to pass before I would be moving off</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards the capital city. In my walk I noticed a young</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man and a girl coming on to the platform, carrying a</span></p><p class="c1"><span>couple</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of bags. The woman was about thirty years, so</span></p><p class="c1"><span>far</span><span>&nbsp;as I could tell, and the </span><span>man about</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;twenty-five. I knew</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">by the way they cast an eye here and there they were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">without knowledge of the way. By my baptism, said I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in my own mind, I think you are a pair of blind </span><span>travellers</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like myself. After a while the young man came over and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>greeted me. We soon made </span><span>acquaintance</span><span class="c0">. He was one of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the O&rsquo;Connors back from Annascaul. Like myself he was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going into the Civic Guard, but without a word of Irish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He made me known to the girl, a sister of his, who was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going to Dublin with him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a great comfort to me to have made friends with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the two of them, for now, thought I, I have found good</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">guides for the journey.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I suppose it is well you know the way to Dublin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I to the girl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh, I </span><span>do so</span><span class="c0">. It&rsquo;s many the day I made the journey,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said she boastfully. &ldquo;Do you know it well yourself?&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she with a little laugh, the kind of laugh a person makes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on becoming acquainted with you for the first time.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Indeed, good woman, this is my first time on the plat-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>form</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;where I am standing now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment a train coming in let out a loud whistle</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which took a jump out of me, but I thought of myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in time. The train stretched up </span><span>alongside of us</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Lord, what a din!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I suppose that is the Dublin train,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the girl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I think it is,&rdquo; </span><span>said she</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, the confusion on the platform, my head split with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the terrible roar throughout the place, boxes thrown out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the train without pity or tenderness, big cans, full of</span></p><p class="c1"><span>milk as I heard, hurled out </span><span>on to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the hard cement. Very</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">good, said I to myself, isn&rsquo;t it often I was complaining of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the fishermen at home making a rush to leave the quay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when there would be a heavy sea, but, indeed, there is</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the same rush on them here though there is neither swell</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nor breakers. Why all the haste or where is the tide com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing on them? Great God of Virtues, the chatter and gabble</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the people! And not a word of Irish to be heard! I don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know in the world what brings strangers into the Blasket</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to learn Irish, for, so far as I can see, when they come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back to this place after leaving the Island they have it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thrown under foot. Look at myself now! What would I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>do if</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there was not a word of English on my lips? Wouldn&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span>I be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a public show? Where is the man or woman would</span></p><p class="c1"><span>give</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me an answer? Will the day ever come when Irish</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will be poured out here as English is poured out today?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I doubt it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Those are the thoughts which were passing through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my mind; no thought of the train or of Dublin, but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yielding to the sight of my eyes, the rush and the roar,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the chatter and laughter, the welcoming one with an-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">other, big fat bucks of men along with lean and lanky</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spindleshanks, and the women likewise.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the midst of my reflections I was struck a blow in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the middle of the back. It was O&rsquo;Connor. &ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he, &ldquo;the train will be going now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ts that so?&rdquo; said I in a flutter.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you no bag?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh, the devil </span><span>take</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it, I forgot.&rdquo; And I leapt towards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the window where I had put it in. &ldquo;Hand me out my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bag, please,&rdquo; said I to the man inside, but in my excite-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ment I spoke to him in Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What&#39;s that?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in English.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I repeated my words in English to him: &ldquo;Where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">is your ticket?&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I began searching my pockets but it was not to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">found. I was now very anxious thinking I would never</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">get the bag without it. &ldquo;I am afraid the ticket has gone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">astray on me,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;but there is my bag.&rdquo; And I pointed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my finger towards it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went inside and handed it out to me quickly. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thanked him and ran off, but, if so, my boy and girl were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nowhere to be seen. Everyone was now in the train and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>my anxiety</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was growing. Up I ran and down I ran. No-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>where could I get </span><span>in.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&lsquo;hen O&rsquo;Connor put out his head</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through a window: &ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said he, and in I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went quickly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It seemed to me that everyone had his eyes on me. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul to the devil, said I to myself, sitting down in their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">midst, anyone would think there were two heads on my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shoulders the way you are all peering at me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to the boy again and we began talking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you are pleased to be going into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guards?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I am </span><span>surely</span><span class="c0">. I am to be up at the Depot at eight o&rsquo;clock</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, God help you, isn&rsquo;t it hard for your&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, before you reach Dublin won&rsquo;t you be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as worn out as an old woman?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about that if I will only pass. Are you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going into them, too?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Not at all. </span><span>It is</span><span>&nbsp;to spend a week in </span><span>Dublin I am going</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked hard at me. &ldquo;It seems you are a pretty in-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dependent man.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, I have enough to do that much for myself.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you are a queer fellow if</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you have all that fondness and affection for money. Arra,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man, while you have it make use of it. What good are you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">unless you travel and study the world while you are in it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At that moment the man of the horn-peaked cap thrust</span></p><p class="c1"><span>his head </span><span>in through</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the window. &ldquo;All tickets ready,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">please,&rdquo; said he, and I could hear him repeating the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing as he passed down. Everyone began to search and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take out his ticket, and a shudder seized me for fear I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would not find my own. I was searching and searching</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and it was not forthcoming, but as luck would have it I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">found it at last in the corner of my pocket. I sat down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again and before long the man entered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tickets, please,&rdquo; said he, and put a hole in each of</span></p><p class="c1"><span>them and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;departed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The train began to move and soon she was passing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rapidly across the country to the east. I got up and put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out my head through the open window. There was not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an inch of the sea to be seen now, but fine broad fields</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and green leafy woods and birds flying over the trees in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">terror of the train, Before long I noticed the train making</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the worm&rsquo;s twist round a turn in the railway. Oh, Lord,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said I to myself, as I saw the length of it, what is drawing</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it at</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all? Is it possible to understand its weight, to say</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nothing of all the people in it? I gave another look ahead</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and what did I see but </span><span>it passing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;under a bridge. When I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came to the bridge myself I had no thought but that my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head had been torn off with the start which was taken out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of me. Quickly I crouched back inside the carriage. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looked round at the people but, if so, I was not at all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pleased with the way some of them were smiling. I looked</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out again to see what had become of the others who were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looking out at the same time. They must have had their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heads torn off, said I, if they were not as quick as myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in crouching back. But musha, when I looked they were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">there still. Before long I saw another bridge, but this time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I drew in quietly, without letting on anything, and I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sat down next to O&rsquo;Connor and the girl. I had another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spell of talk with them and did not feel the time passing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">till the train drew up at the station,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men of the horn-peaked caps were running up</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and down, taking an echo out of the place: &ldquo;Change for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dublin! Change for Cork! Change for Dublin!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>O&#39;Connor nudged me. &ldquo;You are asleep,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am near it. Is this Mallow?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is. Let us get out.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My eyes opened wide to see men and women, their</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bags in their hands, walking across a bridge. What a</span></p><p class="c1"><span>great work! What </span><span>hand of man made</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it? But I let on there</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was no wonder </span><span>on me</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What shall we do now?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the two.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, follow me,&rdquo; said the girl with assurance, walking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on. She led the way up the stairs, across the bridge, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down the other side. Another train was there before us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is the Dublin train now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;get inside.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In we went comfortably, sat down, and away with us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">once more.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was soon deep in thought, looking out through the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">window at the fields and valleys which were darting by,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and looking in at the people, wondering who they were,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from where they had come, or what business had taken</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them from home to send them rushing through the mid-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>dle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of Ireland. I sat meditating on the world. Look, it is</span></p><p class="c1"><span>many a thought</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>comes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the man who goes alone. With</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the power of his mind he brings the great world before his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">face, a thing which is not possible for the man who is fond</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of company</span><span class="c0">. I believe it is in solitude that every machine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and work of ingenuity was created.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I fell asleep. I do not know how long I was so when I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">awoke, the train at a standstill and the ticket man before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Tickets, please!&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I Showed him mine. He looked at me. He put a whisper</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in my ear: &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I Am going to Dublin.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think you have made a mistake. You are half-way to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cork.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He went across to the other two and it was the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with them. Writing something on our tickets he returned</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them to us and went his way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked at the girl who had been so self-confident. She</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was lit up to the tip of her ears. I looked at my ticket. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">writing on it was hard to decipher but at last I made it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out. After a while the girl raised her head and asked me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what was written on it. I was unable to crush down the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ill-will I felt towards her.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a queer thing for yourself to be unable to read</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it?&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and you so smart at making your way to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dublin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There came the size of my fist of a snout on her and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>she</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;turned away from me without saying a word.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned to O&rsquo;Connor. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it 2 bad matter for you,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>who </span><span>have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to be up at the Depot at eight in the morning?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Tt is indeed,&rdquo; said he in vexation, &ldquo;but what is to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">done now? We must go ahead. What is that he wrote on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the tickets?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Here in error,&rsquo; &rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sourly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By now I was like milk and water. I couldn&rsquo;t remain</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">any longer where I was and to have to be looking at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">two of them. I went out into the corridor, my head bent,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking up and down, thinking and ever thinking of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what I ought to do. Would I have to spend the night in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cork? Would I have to pay again for my passage to Dub-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lin? If so, it was a great sin for ever. Och, wouldn&#39;t it be a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine thing to be back in the Blasket now! What prompted</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me to leave it at all?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The train was whistling from time to time, and with</span></p><p class="c1"><span>every</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;whistle anxiety was growing on me. Through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">windows of the corridor I could see, now and then, noble</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gentlemen talking together and laughing merrily. I won-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>der, thought I, if you knew there was a poor </span><span>traveller</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself gone astray, would you give him any help? I sup-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pose you would not, for as the old saying goes, the fat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">does not notice the lean.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The day </span><span>was now almost</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>spent</span><span class="c0">. Glancing out of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">window I saw lights here and there. One more whistle,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and in a few minutes the train was at a standstill once</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">more,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Oh, Lord, </span><span>isn&rsquo;t it there</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>was the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gathering! As soon as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt out, ten hotel-porters began to tear me asunder,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like a swarm of bees you would see humming round a hive</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on a fine summer evening. Running up, a man would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">make a grab at me. &ldquo;Come to Buckley&rsquo;s Hotel! come to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Buckley&#39;s Hotell&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am not staying here tonight.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aren&#39;t you going to America?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I am not. </span><span>It is</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span>Dublin I am going</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">With that he would leave me, still shouting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Up came another man and seized me by the shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Hotel! Come to St. Patrick&rsquo;s Ho-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">tel!&rdquo; The same reply I gave him and away he went. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ragged lad ran up, sending his voice out higher than the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rest: &ldquo;Evening Echo! Examiner! Evening Echo!&rdquo; There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was yet another man, pushing a truck and my head split-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ting with the din he took out of the place. Two, three,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and four here and there among the crowd and they </span><span>whis</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>tling</span><span class="c0">. Oh, wasn&rsquo;t I envious of them, without a care or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trouble in the world! Isn&rsquo;t it a pity I am not an emigrant</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now! Isn&rsquo;t it fine and safe I would be, taken up by the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hotel people!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked back again. O&#39;Connor and the girl were no-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where to be seen. My heart leapt. I looked on this side and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on that. But, if so, it would have been as well for me to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seek a needle in an oatstack as look for those two among</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the crowd passing by like the dark clouds that come out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the sky from the east on a winter&#39;s day. Oh, God send</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me on the right path, said I. What good is it for me to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stand still here like a stock, looking round, ever thinking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and doing nothing. Remember it is not on the top of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Strand you are now, ready to run along the road to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">east towards your house, but in a place where you must</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have an eye in the back of your head as well as the two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that are out before you.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took up my bag and moved on, putting people from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me on every side. Then I noticed coming down towards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me a man who was got up very fine as for yellow bands on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his sleeves and a horn-peaked cap on his head ornamented</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with gold. Faith, thought I, it is likely if I went talking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">with you it is yourself would give me every information</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">about the train.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went up to him quickly. I showed him my ticket and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">told him what was after happening to me since I left</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mallow. &ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t be troubled,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that ticket</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">will take you to Dublin. The train will be leaving in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">three hours, at nine o&#39;clock exactly, and it will land you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in Dublin at half-past three tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A thousand thanks to you,&rdquo; said I leaving him, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as pleased as any other mother&rsquo;s son from here to Halifax,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as an Islander would say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One thing only was troubling me now. There would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not be anyone before me on the station in Dublin. In the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">telegram to my friend I had told him I would arrive at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">half-past seven. Then as luck was in it, with a glance I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gave to the left I saw &ldquo;Telegraph Office&rdquo; written over a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">door. I went in rejoicing and wrote another telegram tell-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing George I had gone astray and to be before me on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">station at half-past three in the morning without fail.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wandered out and courageously I turned my face</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards the city. I walked down through a great broad</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">street and my heart filled with delight when I saw on my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">right hand hundreds of masts beside the quay. &ldquo;Oh, your</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul to the devil,&rdquo; cried I aloud for joy. Recollecting my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>self I</span><span>&nbsp;looked round at once to see if anyone </span><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;listening.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no one. But what did I see but a man standing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up in a corner with a very strange appearance on him&mdash;a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big stick in his hand which he moved from side to side as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">if he were feeling the place with it, his face turned up-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wards, some kind of board hanging down his breast and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>he </span><span>muttering</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to himself. Now and then he would take</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">off his cap and make the sign of the cross. People in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plenty were passing by, but they took no notice of him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">By my baptism, said I to myself, you are a strange one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and it is a great wonder you get no heed from the people</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who are passing. After a while I walked over to him. I</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see now what was written on the board: &ldquo;Have a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heart and help the blind!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Oh, thought </span><span>I, woe</span><span>&nbsp;to </span><span>him who would complain</span><span class="c0">! Oh,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">God, give help to this poor blind man here.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;In the name of God,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;whatever I will do with-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>out money</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I will spare a small sum to you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I put my hand in my pocket and gave him a shilling.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went down the street to the quay. Putting down my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>valise</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;beside me I looked around. The harbour was col-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>oured</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with shipping: steam-ships, sailing ships and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rowing-boats, those far away very small. White gulls in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plenty were flying over the water. As far as I could see</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were houses in hundreds of every hue, some of them of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which you would say they were afire from the sun spar-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>kling</span><span>&nbsp;on the panes and it </span><span>going</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;down in the west. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought of the strong lads and comely girls who had left</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that quay, and mourning came on me as it had come on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them when they left this place and nothing to be seen</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out before them but the edge of the sky.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A voice spoke behind me: &ldquo;I see there is grief on you,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">my boy.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I looked round, He was standing by my side&mdash;a bent</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">old man well worn with the hardship of the world. There</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was a knitted cap on his head, a clay pipe in his mouth,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a grey beard under his chin, and boots up to his knees.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isaw he was a man of the sea.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my asking, is it beyond you are go-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It is not, but near it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your girl that is gone before you likely?&rdquo; said he,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">laughing.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, the cause of my sorrow is every boy and girl</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who was once in my company. They have all turned their</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">backs on this quay, and I am like Usheen left alone after</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the Fianna</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Ah, that is no fault </span><span>in you</span><span class="c0">, young man. It was the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">same with me.&rdquo; And he took out a pocket-handkerchief</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">which had not been washed for a long time by the look</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of it. &ldquo;I tell you I was well off once, a fisherman with a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">motor boat owned by myself and my four sons. But my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sharp sorrow, the fishing fell under foot and my heart was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sorely smitten a year ago on the place where the two of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us are standing now, when my four sons said farewell and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turned their backs to me out through the harbour.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, it is little I thought,&rdquo; cried he mournfully, &ldquo;ye</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would leave me alone as I am!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hunger was oppressing me by this time for I had been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fasting since two o&#39;clock when I had eaten some dry bis-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>cuits</span><span class="c0">, only enough to sharpen my appetite. So I said good-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bye to the old man who was still gazing sorrowfully out,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as if he were talking to the great sea. &ldquo;Musha, my lad, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thousand blessings go with you,&rdquo; said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I walked on quickly through the street. Before long I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was standing outside a big, high church. God of Virtues,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought I, isn&rsquo;t it wonderful the work of men! Who could</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">believe that any human hand would have the power to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pile those stones one on another! I was gazing up at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spire, moving backwards to see it better. A gentleman</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chanced to be passing and in the confusion I struck him</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the back.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said I, looking over my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">shoulder.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He leapt aside and walked on ahead without a word or</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">even a look at me. Isn&#39;t it a wonder the speed there does</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be on the people of a city! Upon my word, my lad, said I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">looking after him, if you had spent five hours seated on</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the thwart of a canoe in a foaming sea you would not be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">such a buck for leaping.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned on my heel and went into the chapel. I knelt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down to offer up a prayer, though it was not of prayers I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>thinking but of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the fine sight before my eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went out again, and it was a great opening was taken</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out of my eyes when I reached the door. Whom would I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">meet coming in but O&rsquo;Connor and the girl?</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We are well met,&rdquo; said I joyfully. &ldquo;It is ever said that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">men meet again but not so the hills or mountains,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Where are you </span><span>all the evening</span><span>?&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, where would I be but in the city of Cork.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Did you have anything to eat yet?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing at all.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wouldn&#39;t it be a good thing for us to get some food.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before we leave for Dublin?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It would surely,&rdquo; said she; but I tell you my heart was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not very bright towards that girl.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were now walking up the street. I noticed O&rsquo;Connor</span></p><p class="c1"><span>sighing. &ldquo;The devil, O&#39;Connor, there is a great </span><span>sighing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you altogether.

When he saw me looking, he cried out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again: &ldquo;Hello, hello, country cauboons!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, it is to the devil I give you if I haven&#39;t the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">slant on you, you dregs of the city,&rdquo; said I aloud in Irish.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When I looked at the two they were laughing loudly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is fine and soft are the shells on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the two of you, but take heed of this, if that brat were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">before my face I would soon make his ears tingle.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think, Sullivan, it is in a temper you are,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O&#39;Connor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The cause of my anger is to see the two of you making</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fools of yourselves laughing like that.

Raise your head,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man,&rdquo; said I, stretching myself up and walking as light as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a bird. And by God, when I looked at O&rsquo;Connor again, he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had his snout turned up like a seal you would see when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>bad</span><span>&nbsp;weather </span><span>would be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;coming. &ldquo;Oh, man,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;don&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take too much of the sky.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no sooner spoken than I saw the word &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">written over a door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I went in, the two following me. You would think at</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that moment I knew the city as well as the mayor, A</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">middle-aged woman came out to us, her head as grey as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a hedgehog and pearls hanging from her ears. She ad-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">dressed the girl. Look, said I in my own mind, how one</span></p><p class="c1"><span>goose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;knows another.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">She directed us upstairs. We went up and into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eating-room where were many tables laid under bright</span></p><p class="c1"><span>cloths</span><span class="c0">, an odd person or two here and there, eating. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sat down together at a table; knives, forks and spoons in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">plenty upon it, and as for the bottles, they took my senses</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from me. As sure as I am alive, said I to myself, Iam ina</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">periwinkle shell now, for it is likely those bottles will</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">work the wrong way with me. I cast an eye here and an</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eye there to watch the people around how they were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">working the bottles. Knife or fork I did not touch yet but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">talking hard, letting on I was in no hurry to begin. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">glanced at O&rsquo;Connor and the girl, and, by God, I saw they</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were country people like myself, for they had the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reluctance to try them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Well, I was making a </span><span>Tigue&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tale of my talk, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watching everyone around till I had learned at last how</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to work the knife, the fork, and the bottle.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; said I, seizing hold of the knife and fork,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it reluctant ye are before the table?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had no sooner done it than the other two did the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">same and they with a mouse&rsquo;s eye on myself. When I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would take up one of the bottles I would hardly have put</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it down again before the other two would snap it up, so</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that if I had taken the salt-jar and emptied it into my tea-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">cup, they would have done the same.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was now half-past eight. It was time for us to hurry</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the train. We left the hotel and walked straight on our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">way till we reached the station.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Proverbial expression for making a short story long.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lights in hundreds here and there, the same ragged lad</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking up and down with the same cry selling papers.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a short time the train gave out a whistle. One jerk</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c0">and away with us.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XXIII. The City of Dublin</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stretched back on the sofa and was soon sound asleep.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I do not know how long I passed in that slumber till the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>whistle</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the train awoke me. I leapt up. O&rsquo;Connor and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>girl</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were still sleeping. A cold shiver struck me. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">soul from the devil, said I, it is often I would complain</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">while stretched on the thwart of a curragh back beyond</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Carrig Valach at such a time, and it is little I thought</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that if I were in a train the same cold shiver would strike</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thrust my head out through the window. The night</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had a lonesome look. It was sharp and cold, nothing to be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heard only the duga-ga-dug, duga-ga-dug of the train and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now and again the fairy music of the wind as it ran in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">against the window-panes. It is far away my thoughts</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were at that moment&mdash;far west in the Blasket. I see the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curraghs back beyond Carrig Valach and hear the glug-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>glag</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of the ripples on their sides. I see others off the strand</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of Yellow Island and yet others down to the west of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Tail, the nets stretched back out of the </span><span>sterns</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and phos-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>phorescence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around them. I see again the old crew&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Shaun Liam, Tigue O&#39;Shea and </span><span>Tomds</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>O&rsquo;Carna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;down at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Tail, their nets in the sea and they talking. Look how</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">they strike their arms together to keep themselves warm!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">IT hear the cdg-cag-cag of the black-backed gulls hovering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the air above the nets and see them swooping down at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the phosphorescence as if it were mackerel. I see a seal</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">snarling behind the nets and hear Tigue O&rsquo;Shea throw a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">curse at him: &ldquo;Blindness and darkness on you, we won&#39;t</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have a fish alive in the nets tonight!&rdquo; Now I can hear the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">grating of the oars as the fishers make for the quay and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not a fish in the bottom of the curragh. I can see them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">going in through the pool, not a sound to be heard but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the lonely murmur of the ripples through the clefts of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rocks in the dead of night, a dog barking in the distance,</span></p><p class="c1"><span>and the whole village </span><span>sound</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;asleep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Duga-ga-dug, duga-ga-dug, then another whistle from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the train. The other two were still asleep. I shut my eyes</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">close and soon the village appeared in perfect likeness be-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fore my face, for &ldquo;with eager desire I was making my full-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>est </span><span>endeavour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to see my love,&rdquo; as the poet said long</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ago. So great is the power of the solitary man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now the train was whistling again. I saw through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">window thousands of lights. Going across to where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">O&#39;Connor was stretched on the other sofa I looked at the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">little watch on his wrist. It was a quarter-past three. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roused them. O&rsquo;Connor sat up and rubbed his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wake up, my boy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;we have made land.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God help us,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and if we have it is time</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Arra, man, you have slept enough now to go up to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">gates of Paradise.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He stretched himself as if the same gates were not to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his liking.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Upon my word, it is little more sleep I will get to-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for likely I won&rsquo;t find a house to let</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart was in my mouth now, for it was so late my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">friend might likely not be before me. The train was en-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>tering</span><span>&nbsp;the station, my </span><span>heart beating</span><span class="c0">. It stretched along-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side the platform. There was no one alive to be seen, only</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a big fat policeman covered well up under his chin. I</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 Carolan.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">took my bag and stepped out, and I tell you I hated the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thought of that city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As I leapt out who was before me but Georgel</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God save you, Maurice, you have brought home your</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">load at last.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&quot;I have, George,&rdquo; said I, shaking him by the hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I cannot describe my relief of mind at that moment to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">see my friend. My thoughts changed so that I was like a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bird for joy.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Well, we had better be going,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">. &ldquo;The motor</span></p><p class="c1"><span>car</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is waiting for us.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two were standing behind me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It wonder, George, could you find a hotel for these two</span></p><p class="c1"><span>who</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with me?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo; And we moved out with him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The motor was not gone far when it stopped outside a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big house. We got out. George put his finger on a little</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">button beside the door.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is that, George?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have only to press that button and the people</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the house will hear a bell ringing within.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cause for laughter from God! said I to myself, if I hap-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pened to be alone and to come to that door, it is the toe</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of my boot it would get and, if so, it is likely I would be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">arrested for it. Soon we heard strides down the stairs and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the door was opened. We said good-bye to the two and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went back to the motor.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, wasn&rsquo;t my heart delighted when the car moved out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the street; wasn&rsquo;t it a great change of view; wasn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wonderful prospect in the dead of night! I looked out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was blinded by the hundred thousand lights, lights on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every side of me, lights before me, and lights above my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>head on the tops of poles. Soon I saw a </span><span>smail</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;light coming</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">towards me like a star through the mist. In half a minute</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>it was </span><span>gone by</span><span class="c0">. It was another motor. Then came another</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">after it and yet another, our own making rings round the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">corners and blowing the horn without ceasing. I don&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know if I am in a dream.

Appar-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ently</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I was in the middle of a wood, for I could see the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stars twinkling in the sky through the trees, and I could</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hear the lonely music of the wind in the leaves, a sound</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that would put a man deeply into thought,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said George. &ldquo;Softly now, for fear we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would wake the people of the house.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He unlocked the door cautiously and we slipped gently</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in. &ldquo;Sh, sh,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">, his lips pouting.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought at once of robbers, but, mo I&eacute;ir, we were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking like mice, for the floor was covered with big, soft</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rugs.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>He went up the stairs, I </span><span>following</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sh, sh,&rdquo; came from him again, ever and ever, until we</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">entered a big, richly furnished room, pictures of noble-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">men long dead hanging on the walls, ornamental furni-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ture</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here and there and wonderful curtains hanging down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over the big, long windows.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was now four o&#39;clock. We were worn out. It was not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long till we were asleep.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About eleven o&#39;clock the next morning the sunbeams</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were pouring in through the curtains and the two of us</span></p><p class="c1"><span>awake, talking and conversing </span><span>of the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;affairs of the Island.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a knock at the door. In came a girl, young,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">handsome, brightly laughing. I saw she was of the flower</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of nobility. She gave me a thousand welcomes, sat down</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and began to pour out tea for us. Soon we were talking at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our ease, especially of my journey to the city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>After </span><span>awhile</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;she went away. &ldquo;Isn&#39;t that a handsome</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">girl?&rdquo; said I to George.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She is, indeed.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was my wonder when I heard that she was mar-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ried</span><span class="c0">!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">About the middle of the day I walked out among the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trees, where there was comfort and delight for the singing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of birds in the branches above my head, the sun sparkling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the leaves and the leaves shaking in the little air</span></p><p class="c1"><span>of wind</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was coming from the west. I walked in among</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them, and the thrush singing above me fine, soft and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sweet. I looked up at him, He seemed to be singing in or-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">der to delight my own heart. He made me think of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span>great</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>world, of</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;things I had never understood before. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see the city clearly at the edge of the sky, great high</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pillars standing here and there and wisps of smoke from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them rising upwards. I was deep in thought considering</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the life of men. I looked east towards the castle, covered</span></p><p class="c1"><span>in ivy and sparrows </span><span>quarrelling</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;amongst it. Isn&rsquo;t it a fine</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">life is given to some rather than to others! I don&rsquo;t know</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">what in the world could trouble the man who lives there,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">though I have often heard it is they who are the worst for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">discontent. It is a great lie. He would need only to sit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">outside his castle listening to the music of the birds for all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sorrow to be lifted from his heart.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I arose again and walked down a pleasant path where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the trees were coming together in close grips above my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head, and a sweet smell from the flowers around me. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walked through the wood till I came to the east corner,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">where the crows were chattering in the branches above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I stopped and looked up. A sort of shame came on me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when I saw them looking down at me, crying cdg-cag-cag</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and. jerking their beaks down towards me as if to drive</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home what they were saying. I thought at once of that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">brat of a Cork lad who had called us country cauboons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Was it any wonder for him to guy me when the rooks</span></p><p class="c1"><span>themselves</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;are mocking me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wandered down to the bottom of the meadow where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">three or four cows were lying in the grass, each as big as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an elephant and with a gloss on their hides from the fat</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of their bodies. I walked back again in the direction of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the castle. I had been out for three hours, though it had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seemed no more than half an hour to me. There was great</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wonder on George and Moya (that was the name of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">woman of the house), for they thought I must have gone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">astray through the city.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Late in the evening: &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you like to pay a visit to the pictures?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart leapt. &ldquo;No doubt of it,&rdquo; said I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We stopped at cross-roads near the castle to wait for a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bus. Oh, King of Virtues, wasn&rsquo;t the street clean! It would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">not harm you to stretch back on it for any dirt you would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have on your clothes. There were many others at the cross-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">roads going to the pictures like ourselves, each boy with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his own girl. Isn&rsquo;t it they have the comfortable life with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">nothing to hinder them but the dry road out before them</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">always. Isn&rsquo;t it a great pity entirely for the poor lads back</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in the Island with nothing for them to sce or hear but the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">big rollers coming up through the Sound and the rough</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">noise of the wind blowing from the north-west across the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hills, and often for four weeks without news from the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mainland! Musha, woe to him who travels not, as the old</span></p><p class="c1"><span>woman</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;said long ago on her first journey out to Dunquin.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I felt a prod in my shoulder. &ldquo;The bus is coming,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">George.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>She comes </span><span>across with a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;loud grating noise. The crowd</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">moves towards her, myself and my companion among</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them. She moves away rapidly. Soon motors and cars of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all sorts are passing each other like ants, the bus turning</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the corners like the wind and a tumult in my head from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the horns blowing to let others know that they are com-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing. Isn&rsquo;t it great the intelligence of the drivers to guard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">themselves against one another! For myself, I did not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">know any moment but I would be splintered,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We reached O&rsquo;Connell Bridge and got out. Trams and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">motors roaring and grating, newspaper-sellers at every</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">corner shouting in the height of their heads, hundreds of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">people passing this way and that without stopping, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every one of them, men and women, handsomely got-up.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&lsquo;The trouble now was to cross the street. A man would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">make the attempt, then another, an eye up and an eye</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down, a step forward and a step back, until they would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">reach the other side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Lord, George, this is worse than to be back off the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">quay of the Blasket waiting for a calm moment to run in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed. &ldquo;Here is a calm moment now,&rdquo; he said sud-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>denly</span><span class="c0">. Off we went in a flutter, George gripping my arm;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now forwards, now backwards, until we landed on the op-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>posite</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;side.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We walked on and I tell you my eyes grew large when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw above me every letter of the &ldquo;Capitol&rdquo; alight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great God, George, look at the wonder above your</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">head!&rdquo; At that moment it went out, but again every letter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was lit up till the whole &ldquo;Capitol&rdquo; was on fire. In defer-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ence</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me, George let on he was as greatly astonished,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">like a mother petting her little child. Well, well, said I to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself, I must change and not show my wonder at any-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">thing else.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went in. Such a building for size! Without any non-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sense it took my senses from me. Stars came before my</span></p><p class="c1"><span>eyes with the sight&mdash;the cleanliness and the </span><span>splendour</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the place within. It was impossible to comprehend it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wonderful is the power of man! We went up a staircase</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">as twisty as a corkscrew and my delight was so great that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I thought of heaven. If it would be as fine as this, it were</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worth fighting and getting sudden death for it. Before</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">long a girl came to us, dressed in a sailor&rsquo;s suit as it seemed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to me, a light in her hand. She showed us to a seat and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">departed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before me now was the fairest sight a sinner&rsquo;s eye ever</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beheld, and strains of music as sweet as fairy music itself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two big curtains slowly parted the way I saw a wood and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a wild desert with great hills covered with snow above. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man comes towards me through the wood, growing bigger</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and bigger until he is the size of a giant. He stops&mdash;a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bright suit on him and a long black beard under his chin.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looks out at the assembly and leans his shoulder</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">against a big tree. Then he opens his mouth and begins a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">beautiful song. Oh, Lord, it is he had the sweet, trem-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bling voice. I thought I was in a dream. And what won-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">der, with the great change which had come into my life</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">so suddenly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">No sooner was the singer gone than the curtains opened</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again. What would there be but about twenty people with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">every kind of music and a man before them with a stick</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in his hand. As he raised the stick the music would rise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When he lowered it the music would fall.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When it ceased the curtains were let down again. A</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">blaze of light was sent throughout the building so that I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">could see all round and the smoke rising up to the rafters</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">from the hundreds of cigarettes that were alight around</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you like the music?&rdquo; said my friend,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The way it is with me, if I were here always I think</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">death could not come near me.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You will change yet, Maurice.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I suppose you are right,&rdquo; said I, and he spoke truly.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The curtain rises again and I tell you it was now I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">astonished to see the loveliest girl my eyes ever beheld</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seated on an ornamental chair, an old lady in bracelets</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and pearls seated beside her. The mother is advising the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">girl not to marry this man but that man. The girl is not</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">content and bursts into tears. Well, there is no need for</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>me to make a </span><span>Tigue&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tale of it, but at the end of the story</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">she escapes with her own fair love, as a woman of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Island would say.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>George stood up. &ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XXIV. The Civic Guard</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On the 28th of April I shook my feathers, made ready my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">mind, washed and cleaned my body till I had the salt</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rubbed out of my skin, and with the sea-tan gone from my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">face and the look of the city swell upon me, I set out for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Depot in Phoenix Park, myself and my friend beside</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A peeler was standing at either side of the gate. George</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spoke to one of them. He told us to wait till he sent in a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">message to the office. While we were waiting, a Guard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">passed with a bugle in his hand. He stood some way off, as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">straight as a candle, put the bugle to his mouth and took</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">an echo out of the square. Then we saw a great company</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of men in Guards&rsquo; uniform coming out, a sergeant walk-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing before them and shouting: &lsquo;&ldquo;&lsquo;Left, left, left!&rdquo; The ser-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>geant</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;stopped and the men passed him in step together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The peeler returned. &ldquo;Come with me now,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He took us into a big room where three or four Guards</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were busy writing and going through papers.

He took out his tape.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He is very thin, only thirty-four inches round the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">chest,&rdquo; said he in English. ~</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And what is the right measurement?&rdquo; said George.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thirty-six.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I became anxious, thinking he was going to throw me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out for the sake of two inches.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ask him,&rdquo; said I to George in Irish, &ldquo;if he had been</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stooping every morning to lift a big heavy hulk of a cur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ragh</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and carrying it on his back to the water, his ribs</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">rattling and doubling under the weight, would his own</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">waist be as broad? And tell him further that when I get</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the beef and mutton into mine it will soon be as good as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Throw off your shoes now till I take your height,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Guard.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;What is the right height?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Five feet nine inches.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He put a sheet of paper on the floor by the wall.

He bent down and drew</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the paper gently from under my heels. I was caught in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">act.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do.

Some forty young men</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were standing inside before me, country boys who had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">been called up. They looked worn and distressed, gazing</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">anxiously around.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I had better be going now,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;and</span></p><p class="c1"><span>leave you in the company </span><span>of the others</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He bade me good-bye and departed.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I had my shoulder against a pillar, looking out lone-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>somely</span><span class="c0">, the other recruits sitting on a long bench talking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">merrily. The Guard with the bugle came out. He stood</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at the corner of the barrack and blew. In a moment</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guards in hundreds were gathering from all directions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were two sergeants in charge and before long I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>heard</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that terrible word, &ldquo; Shun!&quot; You could have heard</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it a mile</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from home. The company crossed the square</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and the recruits got up to look at them. They stopped,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bringing their heels together with a kick. At the same</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time another company came down towards me carrying</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all sorts of music and led by an officer. The officer raised</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">his stick. The music began. The men marched past, the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">merry music filling my ears.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I turned back towards the recruits. Well, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, I had better go and speak with you. I stood watching</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them and soon I noticed one wearing the Irish fainne.t It</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">must be, I thought, that you are from some backward</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">place and know the old tongue. I went across to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;God save you,&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He looked at me in surprise. &ldquo;God and Mary save you,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said he.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He smiled. &ldquo;From Donegal.

He stood before us, looking at it. &lsquo;&lsquo;Patrick Feeney,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">stand out herel&rsquo;&rsquo; And so on till he had called the last man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Squad!&rdquo; he cried, and immediately afterwards the ter-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>rible</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;word &ldquo;&rsquo;Shun!&rdquo; &ldquo;Form fours!

I looked at my pen and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">laughed. O God above, I thought, am I not a fine gentle-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man at last!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">An officer came in with a form for each of us and gave</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us sums to do. Then we were told to write a short essay</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on tillage. I scratched my head. Musha, I don&rsquo;t know in</span></p><p class="c1"><span>the </span><span>world, said</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;myself, will I do it in Irish? Upon my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">word I will. I will let them see I have a respect for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">language.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I seized my pen and attacked the paper vigorously. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">left no stone unturned nor thread unstrung but wrote</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">down everything. I went down as far as the strand in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">end till I had the crop stored.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When we had finished we were ordered to go into the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">city for our dinner, and to be back at three o&#39;clock. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">went out through the gate, the Irish-speaker and myself</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you get on in the examination?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, upon my word,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I found it very</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hard.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you in earnest?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Indeed I am, and I am </span><span>much</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;afraid I didn&rsquo;t pass.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, for if you leave me I shall be a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">pooka entirely.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At three o&rsquo;clock we were sitting in the same place inside</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the gate when the same sergeant came down and called</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">us out as before.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Squad!&rdquo; he cried, and then &ldquo; &quot;Shun!

There we were ordered to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">strip off our clothes. We spent an hour waiting for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">doctor in that way, just as we came into the world, our</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">teeth chattering with the cold.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My own name was called and I went into the room to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the doctor, a very decent man. He took up his instruments</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and put one of them into my back: &ldquo;Say ninety-nine,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">please.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ninety-nine,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Again.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ninety-nine!&rdquo; I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said again loudly, for fear he might find any fault with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Oh, you are as sound as a herring,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It no wonder,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for I was born and bred in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">their company.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He laughed. I put on my clothes and went out.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was past five o&rsquo;clock before everyone had been ex-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>amined</span><span class="c0">. We were ordered to go into the city and return</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">at nine the next morning. I said good-bye to the Irish-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">speaker for I was going to see George who lived in Leeson</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Street.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt on to a tram. Ah, said I to myself when I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">seated inside at my ease, wasn&rsquo;t it true for George when</span></p><p class="c1"><span>he told me the first night that I would soon be </span><span>travelling</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">alone through the city without guidance from any man,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I knocked at the door.

We got up and went to the white gable.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next morning I made my way back to the gate. The</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">other recruits greeted me, especially the Irish-speaker.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;Well, what is your opinion today?&rdquo; </span><span>said I</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The devil I know.

We turned in under a big archway</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and were ordered to wait there till we were called. We</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">spent the time walking up and down to keep ourselves</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">warm, the Irish-speaker and myself talking together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long we heard a voice:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Michael O&rsquo;Callaghan, come in here!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We stopped talking at once. The boy went in. We all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">watched the door with beating hearts, waiting for the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">news he would bring. Soon he came out with a look of</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">weeping. He walked up and held out his hand to one</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lord God, what&rsquo;s wrong, Mick?&rdquo; said the other fellow,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">taking his hand.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&ldquo;I did not pass,&rdquo; </span><span>said he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;with tears in his eyes.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah, what harm, mane&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It might be</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all for luck.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He shook hands with us all and went his way.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then another was called in, and he came out in the</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>1 You are settled for life, </span><span>said of a</span><span>&nbsp;girl after her match </span><span>is made</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">same fashion, until twelve had been struck off the books.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Among them was my Gaelic companion.

But we said to each other</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">that the same end was in store for us all, and so we had</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">given up hope. I heard my own name called. My heart</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was in my mouth with the flutter of fright that came</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">over me, for I had no thought, of course, but that I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">would get the same treatment as the rest. I went in.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Guard who was there before me, &ldquo;you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">have passed, boy.

Five or six of us</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">were put in each. My eyes opened wide when I saw about</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fourteen small beds along the walls. Ah, it is now I was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in a place where I would have to keep my two eyes well</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">open. I was acquainted with no one.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Clare man was there, the Galway man and the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Cork man, the city swell and the country lad&mdash;the Blasket</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man among them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I sat down on my bed.

I was tired and weary, without</span></p><p class="c1"><span>vigour</span><span class="c0">, pleasure, or mirth. I knew well I was under con-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>trol</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;again. It is often I had complained during my school</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">days and said to myself, if I were a grown man I would</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">be content. But look at me now without anyone around</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me who knows me. I drew out my pipe, filled it and lit</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up. But seven times it went out, for I would forget to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">keep it alight with all the thoughts which were running</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through my mind.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I jumped up, took off my clothes and got into bed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A fellow here and a fellow there was glancing at me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I swear by the devil,&rdquo; said one of them, &ldquo;the recruit</span></p><p class="c1"><span>above means to get </span><span>his</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;sleep.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I took no heed. I stretched back, turned on this</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side and that. But it was no use, for the hard thwart was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">piercing my back. I thought of the old soldier in the red</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">army. No sleep was falling on me. How could itr&mdash;a man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here singing a snatch of a song, another laughing, two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">more wrestling all over the room and now and then fall-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing on top of me, a man playing a flute, another a fiddle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Lord, said I, it is often I would complain of the roar</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the waves below the house on a rough winter&rsquo;s night at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home, but upon my word I am in a madhouse now.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while a sergeant came in. The noise stopped,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all without a word like mice at sight of a cat.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Lights out!&rdquo; he cried,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The lights were put out and everyone groped through</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the darkness to his bed. Well, thought I, it was no harm</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to give you that much. Maybe you will be a little quieter</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for the rest of the night. But indeed it was not so, for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">when they were stretched out on their backs they sur-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">passed themselves. Not a wink of sleep could I get for</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">all the chatter and clatter through the room, and from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time to time a train whistling from afar. Not a sound</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">came to my ears that night but I heard it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At six o&#39;clock, not a moment before or after, I heard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the bugle blowing. A man leapt from his bed. &ldquo;Wake</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up, lads,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;remember you are far away from</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">home now!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Lord, wasn&rsquo;t I vexed and tormented without a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">wink of sleep all night. Everyone was getting up, stretch-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing and yawning, especially the recruits like myself whose</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">bones were reluctant. It would have been little use for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">you to say that morning, &ldquo;Wait a while, I will be getting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">up now.&rdquo; Ah my sorrow, you would not soon have for-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>gotten</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went out and made for the wash-house, clamour</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">and confusion, everyone shaving himself hastily. In ten</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">minutes we were washed and clean. Then the bugle blew</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">again,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We went out into the square. The sergeant was stand-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing there before us, calling the roll. It was there I heard</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the first word of Irish. As he called out each name, a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man would answer &ldquo;Annso!&rdquo;+ and, believe me, there</span></p><p class="c1"><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;many who spoke it with an English accent.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were about four hundred of us in the square</span></p><p class="c1"><span>now</span><span>, the </span><span>adjutant out</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;before us.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Company!&rdquo; he shouted,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone was ready waiting until there came the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sickening word, &lsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Shun!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">What a wonderful throat that same adjutant had!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Form fours!&rdquo; he cried again. &ldquo;Right turn! Left turn!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Quick march!&rdquo; and away we went into Phoenix Park.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Discontented though I had been ever since I went into</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Depot, a cloud was rising from my heart now when</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">1 &ldquo;Here.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I saw the view&mdash;the earth white with snow, the foliage on</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the trees bending under the burden they were carrying,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the wind whistling shrilly through the wood. Hundreds</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of crows were flying from tree to tree, and before long I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">saw a couple of deer galloping away from the terrible</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">host which was approaching. Musha, did I not think at</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">once of the Fianna, of Oscar and Conan Maol and Goll</span></p><p class="c1"><span>mac</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Morna.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We had marched a couple of miles into the Park when</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">we were given that strong word, &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; which ran</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the woods like a whirlwind. &ldquo;Fall out!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We left the ranks and sat down in rows by the road-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">side. I was sitting with my back against the ditch, listen-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing to a blackbird singing above my head. Musha, isn&rsquo;t</span></p><p class="c1"><span>it many</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>a thing</span><span>&nbsp;it </span><span>put</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me in mind of! The sun was climb-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ing the sky and all the birds greeting it; sounds of all</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">kinds were passing through my ears&mdash;the voice of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">birds, the whistling of the trains, the grating of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">trams, and the lonely sound of the wind in the woods.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long I heard a shout which went through the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">back of my head: &ldquo;Fall in!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I leapt up. Everyone was making for the road and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">standing shoulder to shoulder. I took my place among</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them, and away we marched again.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">On our return to the Depot, we were ordered to go</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for our breakfast. We ran like a flock of sheep to the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">hall. My eyes opened in wonder to see forty long tables,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">twenty on each side of the hall and twelve men at each.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>But </span><span>indeed it was a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>meagre</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;portion was laid before us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking round I soon saw everyone laying down the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knife and fork on his plate, I thought it very queer but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">did the same. Since you are in Rome, said I, it is as well</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for you to be a Roman. &lsquo;Then I saw the superintendent</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">walking down the middle of the hall. He stopped:</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Any complaints?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; cried a hundred voices together.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was then I understood that they had stopped eating</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out of homage to him.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, no sooner were we seated in our own room after</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the meal, and cigarettes in our mouths, when the bugle</span></p><p class="c1"><span>was blown again. God be with us </span><span>for ever</span><span class="c0">, said I to my-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">self, isn&rsquo;t it a discontented and vexatious world when a</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">man wouldn&#39;t get time to have his smoke!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were turned right and turned left till we came out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">into the square. &ldquo;The last batch of recruits, fall out</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">here!&rdquo; cried the officer.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">We were put in charge of a sergeant, a small, short,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">haggard, rough-voiced fellow with a pale face and two</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">eyes like candles. He stood out before us and began by</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">giving a lecture on what we had to do, turning right and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">left, kicking the square as he brought up the other foot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he gave us a command.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Squad!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;&rsquo;Shun!&rdquo; and I noticed the sinews</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of his neck ready to burst with the strain. &ldquo;Right turn!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">he shouted again. We turned right. &ldquo;Quick march!&rdquo; and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away we marched up the square.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sergeant remained where he was, and as we moved</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away from him he was like a dog barking in the distance,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After half an hour&rsquo;s hard toil he dismissed us. We re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">turned to our room, running with sweat, worn out, and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">weary,</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I spent three months drilling in that fashion, until I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was as thin as an eel without a drop of sweat in my body,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">One night in the beginning of September, about three</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">o&#39;clock in the morning, the boy in the bed next my own</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">let out a scream and told us to call a doctor. Everyone</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">was awake in a moment and the room in confusion. The</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>doctor</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;came. He immediately ordered the boy to hospital.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next day we were all moved to another room that</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our own might be disinfected. &ldquo;And you will be very</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">lucky,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;if none of you has caught it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was right. I was suddenly struck down myself and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sent off to hospital. I spent a couple of days there, getting</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">worse. Then they moved me down to the Fever Hospital</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in Cork Street, where I lay without wish for food or for</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drink, worn out with the world, nothing around me but</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">white beds, an old man on one side and a boy with his</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">own complaint on the other, another being brought in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">on a stretcher, a smell of drugs and of sickness through-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">out the place. How vexed and tormented I was, especially</span></p><p class="c1"><span>when I would see every other patient visited by his </span><span>peo</span><span class="c0">-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">ple, for no one was coming to me. My friend was over</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in England and the people of the castle on holiday in the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">west. As for my own kin they were all on the other side</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">of the world, and I miserable that I had not followed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">them. Och, isn&rsquo;t health a fine thing! Woe to the man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">who would complain so long as he could walk out and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">take a draught of the sweet air of heaven. I would often</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">think of the days gone by when I would be hunting with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">a light heart on the summit of the Cr&eacute;, or fishing on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">top of the waves or playing ball on the White Strand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not a man in the Blasket then who could keep up with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">me in the race. Often too I would think of the night</span></p><p class="c1"><span>when the </span><span>traveller</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was telling us beside the fire of the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">days he had spent in the red army and the old soldier he</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">had met in the hospital. Little I thought then that I</span></p><p class="c1"><span>myself</span><span>&nbsp;would be in the same </span><span>case</span><span class="c0">. How little any man</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">knows what is before him!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">However, I was not thinking of dying yet. I passed</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">six weeks in hospital, four on the flat of my back and</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>two walking in the garden. Happily and </span><span>gai</span></p><p class="c1"><span>tentedly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I spent those two weeks though I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">but the skin to keep my bones together, and i</span></p><p class="c1"><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tears in my eyes when I was leaving.</span></p><p class="c7 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><h2 class="c7"><span class="c4">XXV. Connemara</span></h2><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was on the 10th of November. After a good hour&rsquo;s</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">drilling in the square, we went into the schoolhouse as</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">usual to learn points of law. We had just sat down, with</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">our books open, when the superintendent called my</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">name.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Annso!&rdquo; I answered.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">He called another name. &ldquo;Annso!&rdquo; was the answer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he called a third. &ldquo;Annsol&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have to examine the three of you</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">for sending you into the country.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oh, Lord, I trembled hand and foot. I had made no</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">preparation for it. How could I, after spending six weeks</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">in hospital without looking at a law at all? Well, I pulled</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">myself together. How lucky I would be if I passed today!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your soul to the devil,&rdquo; a lad whispered to me, &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">fine for you to be leaving this devilish place?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My heart was in a flutter when I saw the superintend-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>ent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;preparing to begin the examination. He took me</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">first, and questioned me about at least nine acts. I an-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>swered</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;each question. He stopped and raised his head.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&#39;s not too bad,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;after all the time you</span></p><p class="c1"><span>spent </span><span>in hospital</span><span class="c0">.

I was walking</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">across the room and I doubt if there was any man in</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Ireland at that </span><span>moment as happy</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;as I.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Musha, it is a pity I&#39;m not in your shoes now,&rdquo; said</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">one of the lads.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Take it easy, boy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;your own day will come</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">yet.

Again I overheard that angry word,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Shun!&rdquo; and with a glance through the window I saw</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the recruits out on the square being cursed by the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">sergeant.

I said good-bye to Shaun and was driven</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">away to Broadstone. I bought my ticket and entered the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">train.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I was seated at my ease, thinking and reflecting on the</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">world, I in Guard&rsquo;s uniform going out to Connemara to</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">enforce the laws. Musha, isn&rsquo;t it little ] thought a short</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">time ago that I would ever go on such a journey!</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">My fare was paid to Moycullen, wherever that was. I</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">got up and looked out of the window. The day was</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">threatening and heavy snow lying on the hills. I listened</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">to the sound of the train and thought of my first journey</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">through the middle of Ireland.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while we stopped and I heard them shouting,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Change for Clifden!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I took up my bag, went out and crossed the bridge,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">now as used to that work as any old dog.

Before long one spoke to the other in Irish. My</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">heart leapt with love of that language, though I found</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">it hard to understand them, for they were speaking in</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">the Connacht dialect.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It looks like rain today, Cole,&rdquo; said one of them.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It does indeed,&rdquo; said the other man.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How far is it to Moycullen, Cole?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, we are not far from it now.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I dare say it is after the poteen the peeler is going,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">said the other fellow with a glance at me.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">They looked at each other, smiling.
